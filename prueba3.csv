Got take-out from here last night and it was HORRIBLE! Something must have happened because they only had 3 people working and were VERY disorganized. Should have checked the food before we left! Ordered fajitas and there was very little meat... it was beyond ridiculous. Hardly any peppers but a plethora of what looked like stewed tomatoes. Look... I'm a gringa and I know that don't look right and I could do a way better job. The rice was missing completely and there was only one giant pizza pie looking tortilla. We called and the person who answered could barely speak English (which is really not a big deal in my book) but there was no manager around to resolve the situation. We asked for an email so we could send a note about the experience but she was unhelpful. All she offered was for us to come back right then...which if you were as hungry as my fiance was not an option. He gets grumpy and I know better than mess with a grumpy-hungry-pants.,
Girls are sweet and prices are reasonable. The stand up bed is hot so make sure you adjust your time ( I might just be super white lol),
Rudest people I have ever encountered.  Husband and wife owned business and when I called for service the wife was unbelievably and unnecessarily rude and demanding.  Don't waste your time calling.,
"This airport is only coveted for the destination that it leads its fliers too... the view of the Strip is the only thing that redeems this hotel. The tacky slot machines in the center of the terminal is one thing, but they dont even have a smoker's lounge (its vegas for god's sake!) There are not that many options for food at the airport. Also, it is a TINY airport with a lot of traffic and THE TRAFFIC LINE OF DOOM in itself is a catastrpohe. To its defense, you can drink while you are in line, which i saw many people doing.",
"The last 4 months have shown a steady decline in this piss-poor service. Where shall I start?\n\nFor two weeks in a row now, I can count on OnDemand crapping out on Friday evenings. Try to navigate through selections and the entire module shortly becomes a nice blue screen of death and then freezes - no buttons work, no exit, nada. Reboot required. Now the \""2 weeks in a row\"" doesn't just mean it's happened twice. Just twice *in a row* on a Friday evening. OnDemand overall is chronically unstable.\n\nAnd how about trying to record a show? Simple right? Oh think again... We've had several instances over the last couple of months where the last 10 minutes is just POOF - gone. Show ends with a lovely message, \""This show has stopped recording\"" or some such other nonsense. And it's not because the show's schedule got off (i.e. started late, making the end time after the top of an hour).\n\nThen there's the guide showing the name of one show (the one we think we want to record), but when we record and play it back, it's a completely different show! That's always fun.\n\nOh, and lets talk signal quality. For no apparent reason (well, is ANY of this for any apparent reason?) the HD picture will pixelate and become chunky and move sporadically or freeze and the audio sounds like a robot stuck singing the note B flat.\n\nAnd please don't bother trying to use the Search feature in OnDemand. More freezing typically awaits and yep, a reboot is usually required since none of the buttons on the remote can end the nightmare.\n\nYou folks have a LOT of work to do. And I'll bet I'm not wrong in saying you also have a LOT of unhappy customers. And with very good reason. Bad software, bad network, bad delivery, BAD SERVICE. I've never experienced such sustained poor quality from a provider.\n\nTonight was finally the last straw and will be happily entertaining other sources for our TV content next week.",
"Excellente bouffe, pas trop cher. L\u00e9gumes et herbes de qualit\u00e9s. Portions g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses. Souvent, le restaurant se remplis rapidement apr\u00e8s 17h, alors pr\u00e9voyez le coup. Recommandable!",
The Phoenician is a dated property and in need of a facelift.  Spend your money elsewhere!,
"This is our Sunday after-church destination. Phenomenal hummus, pitas, pizza, and wraps. We like the hummus trio with grilled chicken, add extra pitas and cucumbers. After that go with the mahi mahi. Our kids love the lavash pizza and red lentil soup. Get a half and half of the tropical and green iced tea and they'll always offer up a to-go cup on the way out. \n\nMy wife and I walked to the PJ in Tempe off Apache during college and now have one within biking distance again! Great vibe, healthy delicious food, and good service!",
Happy hour from 2-5pm for slushies and 8-midnight for shakes.,
"Hurry in and try this Ginger Cinnamon Latte!! I added carmel sauce and soy milk over ice in their large, a whopping 32oz size, Delish!! The flavor combination was amazing! I would drive out of my way any day for this place. \n\nTucked behind Fox and Hound Pub & Grill this coffee shop is small, but warm and inviting. The staff was very helpful and friendly, my barista even asked me to try this unusual concoction, upon pickup, to make sure I liked it. I was in love! I may have found my new coffee stop. \n\nComparable to *bucks pricing but has a much truer taste without the burnt espresso taste = worth it! They also have a convenient drive up window. (Yay! now I can pickup this coffee goodness in my pjs!)",
