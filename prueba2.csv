-1,"Eat at Fioris, they said.  Youll like it, they said.\n\nis it conveniently located on West Liberty Boulevard, this restaurant features absolutely nowhere to park on the road that is impossible to get to.\n\nWhen I called to place our order a miserable sounding me an answer the phone with the side and then said what do you need? I placed our order and he said don't come down here it's going to be at least an hour to we can get to you if my coworkers can do anything right. That was really unprofessional. Some people may think that character but really I don't care what kind of a day the person taking the pizza order is having I just want to place my order without feeling im bothering them,\n\nYou should know that you will have to illegally parked your car to pick your order up.  the place was filthy inside and it was packed full of people and total mayhem. I would never ever recommend eating in store even if the place was clean up you're still going to have people waiting to pick three orders of standing right over you. It was also about a hundred degrees in there. They also only take cash with they didn't mention and there was no sign so I was glad I had cash on hand.\n\nI knew that something was up with the pizza 13 started leaking through the lid of the pizza as we were driving it home. The bottom and the top rated with grease. How does that even happen? My friend said that's a sign of a great pizza but he is a guy and we have other eating priorities it was disgusting. You're not supposed to take a slice of pizza up out of the pizza box and have all of the toppings slide off due to thebgrease.  the only restaurant that could get away with pizza that greasy is Vincents and they are now gone..you could caulk a bathtub with the cheese that's how rubbery it was. It was disgusting. the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added. It was gross I don't understand why anybody likes this restaurant but the poor service and the poor quality of the food is a prime example of a restaurant resting on the laurels of its legacy."
-1,"I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a \""lemon\"" of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \""meat,\"" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \""amazing.\""  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades."
1,"This is my go to place for a really good beef enchilada. The red sauce is always flavorful, and the combo with rice and beans will surely satisfy your cravings. Even the rice and beans are delicious, and remind me of home. I'm never afraid to just order a good ol' bean & cheese burrito. With their salsa verde, it is the perfect choice if you just want something simple. Of course, they do have carne asada, a typical staple for any Mexican food joint, and theirs is pretty darn good. I always get it as a quesadilla, and I'm always happy with the decision. Don't let their old school tables fool you, this place is full of good food!"
-1,"Not impressed. When I ordered the Oyako bowl, the conversation went something like this: \nMe: What type of sauce comes on the Oyako bowl? \nFemale employee: Chicken \nMe: Yes, I know it has chicken in it, but what type of sauce comes on the chicken and rice? \nFemale employee: Chicken sauce \nNico: Just order it Teresa \nMe: Ok, can you substitute noodles for rice, please? \nFemale employee: Puzzled look of total confusion \nMe: Repeated the above question \nFemale employee: Uhhh, no, no substitute for noodles \nNico: This is not the time to be picky Teresa \nMe: Fine (as I'm looking at the sign that states \""Substitute noodles for rice for $0.80) \n\nNow I can see why the employee was so confused. There was NO sauce in my rice bowl. It was just chicken, rice, egg, and green onions. I had to add soy when we got home and I am not a huge fan of soy. Nico raves about this place and he very much enjoyed his Teriyaki rice bowl. I will go again and try something else, and I will probably make him order for me."
-1,"This is the first time ever I wrote a bad review but I am just that frustrated with Hertz CLT.  I was nodding my head on all the negative reviews on Hertz CLT location cause that is my personal experience also.  I am a Gold Circle member but apparently it makes no difference at this location.  I got on-time Carfirmation once out of five rentals in Sept  and your name is not on the board either.  It is true the lines are super long and not unusual to wait in line at least for 20 mins or more even if you are a Gold Circle member and that you had reserved the car properly.  It is also embarrassing to drive a car to the client site, of which has dents and scratches all over.  One time the car they gave me has 67,000 miles on it and the Hertz employee wrote on the paper dents and scratches all over because there were so many.   Most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful.  I asked why I don't get Carfirmation or find my name on the board, the lady just rolled her eyes and there was no apology.  It is also true you always have to wait for the shuttle.  I would see two Avis shuttle come and go and 10 or 15 mins later I will see the Hertz shuttle.  I have also completed survey and sent in complaints to Hertz but nothing has changed.  The only reason I have not switched is because of good services received at other cities and my assignment in Charlotte ends in Dec and I don't have to deal with Hertz CLT any more.\nRichard... Thanks for your response.  RR 543397190 has miles out 66,900 (9/21/14) and miles in at 67,054 (9/27)"
-1,"I don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food.  The place is dated and could use updating.\n\nThe waitress was good.  I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.\n\nThe food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it.  Her first bite she made a sour face.  My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that.  Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto.  The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. \n\nMy son and I had the fried seafood platter.  Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor.  The breaded shrimp tasted weird too.  Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. \n\nOn the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good.  The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's.\n\nThis was our first, and more than likely, our last, visit.  For a $65 dollar meal, it wasn't worth $10. ."
1,"This is a frequent dining spot for me. There are not to many options in downtown Phoenix, however this place has a great variety. I am not a sandwich gal or a fan of deli's though Paradise Bakery has a great variety on their menu to offer for all types of eaters. Everything is fresh. They have daily soup options and tasty crisp salads to go. As far as the deserts (cookies, brownies, etc) All I can say is YUMMY! \n\nThe staff is always friendly. The management team is always upbeat and greets all visitors who walk through the door. \n\nThere is indoor and outdoor seating. This place gets busy so they offer call in to go orders. \n\nFor a healthy option this is the place to go."
1,I'm pretty happy with my purchase today. I found a pair of man's sandals and looked like it's under sale. The store guy told me it was on sale last week but no longer. Then I asked if he can do me a favor to give me the sale price and he agrees. I checked out but continue shopping for something else and got about $40 other things. I then asked the check out guy if I can return that shoes and combine all the things I want to buy so that I can use a 10 off 50 coupon. He agrees with the manager's consent and did working for a while to return my shoes and combine my stuffs together.
1,"This is by far one of my favorite spots!! \n\nIt's kind of hidden near the theater area, so it can be hard to find. The inside is dark and chic. It's classy and trendy. This place is for almost everyone, there are hipsters and the \""I live in the biltmore estates\"" and just regular people. It's great! It's perfect for when you don't feel like having a wild night and just enjoying a quieter night with friends. Their drinks are Delish! And so are the appetizers! Service is awesome! Music is good!\n\nAwesome place all around!"
-1,"Do not use this dry cleaner. The staff/owner smokes in the store. There are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around. I had to \""air out\"" my clothes after I picked them up from Galardi's to try to get rid of the cigarette smell. YUK!"
-1,"What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my \""go-to\"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  \n\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \""qualified\"" for delivery to the store.  \""When will the items be restocked?\""  \""Don't know.\""  \""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\""  \""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? \n\nThe staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \n\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \n\nVERY disappointing to me."
-1,"I have heard a good amount of positive reviews of this place from lots of different people. That being said, I was expecting to be wowed by their burgers, which is the reason people told me to go. \n\nHowever, when I arrived with my guest, 8:00 PM on Thursday night, I was kind of disappointed. Not only did the waitress take a good 10 minutes before she brought us water, but she was not very attentive and never checked back with us until she brought the bill. The burger was so-so with little flavor, which was very disappointing. I could also tell that a few other tables in my section were looking around waiting for their server.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed by the quality of food as well as the service."
1,"This is just a standard TGI fridays rebranded for the baseball park.  That being said, we no longer have TGI fridays in Hawaii, so the food was a new experience for me.  I went on a Monday at noon, so as expected, there was not many people.  We were able to sit by the windows that overlook the park, which was breathtaking to me.  (Dont have a professional baseball stadium in Hawaii either) \n\nSo, in terms of the food, my Auntie and Grandparents got the endless lunch.  Around $7-8 I think.  It came with Unlimited Breadsticks, soup and salad.  Only bad thing is that the French Onion is a one-order soup, and not unlimited without a small charge.  Thats bad because I absolutely LOVE french onion soup.  But my Grandparents and Auntie loved their food.  \n\nI had the Korean Beef tacos.  Love it.  Good flavor, and rather large portion.  (TIP from my Auntie, ask for potsticker sauce on the side and pour it on the rice and/or tacos) \n\nThe customer service was great, our waitress was super friendly and conversational.  Since it was pretty much empty, we walked outside to look at the stadium from the balcony they have.  While we did that, another employee got confused and cleared away our drinks and utensils.  Our waitress noticed before we came back and replaced it all.  She also took our picture outside for us.  Shame I dont remember her name to give her recognition on here. \n\nOverall, \n\nFood- 9/10\nPrice: 7.5/10\nLocation- 10/10\nCustomer Service: 20/10\n\nThe food and everything else was great, but it was the waitresses customer service that absolutely put it over the top."
-1,"BEWARE!! \n\nI had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \""it must have vibrated off after service.\"" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \""vibrated off\"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest."
1,"I have been using this clinic for over 20 years.   Being active in many different sports and outdoor activities I often have need for a chiropractor.  They are always professional, friendly and go out of their way to see me. Even adjusting me on a weekend at the Dr's home a time or two when I'd badly thrown something out."
-1,UPDATE! Received an email from the owner which was a little intimidating stated that I should remove my post. Kinda think they should improve customer service then send an email.
-1,"Always make sure to scrutinize a resturant review from a college student.\nIt's more than likely based on the cost of beers rather than food quality. \nMy sushi was warm, food was cold, and the chicken in my stir fry tasted old."
1,"I was unfortunate enough to be stranded in Phoenix a couple of years ago during a major downpour.  11pm, all flights grounded, you can imagine the airport was kind of a mess.  Most hotels were all booked up at that point, but I snagged a last minute room at the Ritz (for something like $450/night, so I must have stayed in one of the nicer rooms).  I'm not a huge fan of having to fight my luggage away from hotel staff, but that's a service many people expect.  The staff at the Ritz offer that and more... \n\nI was pretty impressed by the old world styling of the place because it felt classic instead of outdated.  Even though it was late, room service is always open, so I scarfed down a delicious burger and fries (complete with those cute little bottles of ketsup and mustard) then crashed.  My stay was short-lived, but definitely memorable."
-1,"Wow, where to begin?  We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\"" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \""kitchen\"" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \""manager\"" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \""sure bet\""!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?  Wow, what a way to make a transition in business ownership!!! Someone please help these clueless owners/managers!!"
1,"My go to place for Mexican food. Chimichangas, enchiladas and menudo are my favorites . Big portions , decent price."
1,"I love the food selection at this place!  As someone who spent many years \""across the pond\"" I've learned to appreciate good european food.\n\nMy top foodie recommendations at this store:\n\n- Torani sugar free Black Cherry syrup and CostPlus sparkling water to make your own soda\n\n- The fondue cheese packs\n\n- Heinz cream of tomato soup\n\nIf you try just these 3 things you will glimpse nirvana!"
-1,"Skip. The Enchiladas are like a bad day at a sewage treatment plant. A revolting brown sauce, inedible beef, fake cheese, and a bizarre flavor that leaves one gagging. The rice is flavorless and the chips (which came with the meal) taste days old. Hey at least the canned refried beans can't be screwed up."
-1,"It was great the last few times...\n till I found a dried piece of spinach stuck on my fork when I unwrapped the silverware, and dishes had crumbs encrusted on them."
-1,"we checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like, moldy ceilings,  musty smells, unclean rooms, and such a huge renovation job it should be shut down or discounted by 99%! thank god hotwire gave us a refund."
-1,"Awful. The sweat panted ( hey put a little effort in to it ) crabby ( if you you think your job sucks find a different one ) ' barista' ( being able to work an espresso machine is not that much more difficult than a mr coffee) at least gave me some fodder for crappy service reviews. Lazy, dirty, and angry is no way to garner tips. I didn't drink the coffee afraid she spit in it."
1,I'm here for happy hour prices can not be beat the shrimp cocktail is out of this world the cocktail sauce will make you sit up and take notice! Service was very lack luster the waitress was more interested in talking with men at the bar then seeing if I needed more ice tea...
1,Excellent railroad shop. I use them for terrain supplies as they seem to have the best selection in SE valley.
1,"I like this palce since it's so accessible. You don't have to hike all the way up, even though you can and people do. But I always drive up and the drive is a relaxing winding mountain road that has great views of the valley. It's right in the middle of the city so it's very accessible. Sunset is absolutely beautiful here and I'm sure it's the makeout point type of destination lol. But yeah people are always taking sunset pics up here and my dog loves the trip."
-1,"I order it for my employees occasionally.  The pizza is what you expect, nothing better than OK.  They throw on an extra $1.50 for delivery charge and the drivers tell us that most goes directly to the managers pockets.  That Sucks."
1,Spectacular!\nGreat comfortable environment and delicious inexpensive food.  If you love hot dogs this is your place.  They have lots of variety but don't go overboard and mess up a simple delicious hot dog.  One thing i can never forget about this place is the soda.  Sounds peculiar I know but they mix it perfectly and shave the ice into almost powder mmmmmm.  Very nice owners who run a great business so if you like supporting local business im sure thy could use your business.   Only open for lunch but definintely beats stealing coworkers leftovers from the work fridge. I hear not so great things about their burgers but i go there for the hot dogs so I've never had that problem.  Highly Reccomended!\n\nRecommend: footlong
-1,"This was my first trip to Charlotte. I've looked up other hotels in the area and have decided upon the Omni. The Omni is very overrated. When we checked-in, they had a five day wedding celebration in progress. No bell captains available upon check-in. When we got up to the room, I was very surprised to see how outdated it was for the money. Ripped curtains, blown out light bulbs in bathroom. And most of the extra electrical outlets did not work. I had my cell phone charging, come to find out the outlet never worked. I switched it to another outlet, and, again, no charge. Upon my morning cup of coffee in the room, the mini creamers were sour. I called room service, and they never brought them up. Nor did they refresh the coffee station when they cleaned the room. No fresh creamers and two sugars for two days! I take my coffee serious. Lol. The second day in the morning starting at 7:00 AM, I was woken by a pounding sound of music coming from the courtyard. This was the ritual going on for the wedding. It continued for two hours. If the wedding was going to be honored on the lower floors, they should have put the other guests on the upper floor to avoid all the commotion. The garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days. No one took the responsibility of emptying them. We paid good money for a nice, clean, quite break. Only to have nothing but a out of date room, tons of noise, and a unclean looking surrounding. Guests should have been forewarned of the wedding festivities when booking. Although, the staff was very accommodating, they weren't on a mini vacation, we were. The only thing we were offered was free coffee or a breakfast beverage in the morning ! Also, be aware, if you don't join their rewards club, check your bill for a $9.95 a day charge for Internet. We were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all. See attached pictures."
-1,"Nice atmosphere. Like an upscale Starbucks. We ordered coffee, chai, a breakfast sandwich and quiche of the day. Was told drinks would be out in a few minutes but food would take 40 minutes. Don't know if its always like that or if they were just short staffed. But seriously 40 min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich? We told them just make the drinks, forget the food. Even so the drinks took 11 minutes. This place has potential but a wait like that is crazy. Would not recommend until they work their production issues out. One star. Disappointed."
1,"Newsflash!!  After 10 years of living in the East Central Phoenix area, I have FINALLY found my \""go-to\"" Greek place.   It's like comfort food, but it's the entire restaurant.  \n\nMy cousin and I stumbled into this place --- the location is a bit difficult to find otherwise.  We were waiting for our nail appointment at Andy's salon a few doors down and decided to grab dinner since we had time to kill.  Little did we know what happy customers we soon would be!   An affordable, local, delicious Greek restaurant which quickly earned a #1 rating in my book!  Can't wait to go back and try more!  \n\nThe woman who took our orders and cooked the food was just so wonderful!  She recommended the Spicy Chicken pita to me, so I took her word  (see my Humble Pie review, where I learned my lesson for not following restaurant recommendations!).  It was a great choice!!   My cousin had the gyro pita, which was melt in your mouth delicious too.  We also shared a spanekopita, which was just so fresh and well made.  It was piping hot food, she cooked to order (hold the onions for me!), and the flavors were perfect. \n\nThe portions were great, the hummus was tasty, the pita so soft and perfectly grilled.  The Olympic Flame has even mastered the use of garlic, which many restaurants seem not to be able to manage.  The only downside to this place is that I guess I won't scare vampires off at night after eating here (see my previous review of Eden's Garlic Grill if you are looking to keep the vampires away), but I will sleep well with a fully belly and leftovers in the fridge for tomorrow!"

-1,"My girlfriend and I drove here after seeing it on \""triple d\"". \nWe got there just before the rush and were seated pretty quickly.\n\nThe osso bucu was...okay. Big hunk of pork with alot of bone on okay pasta.... The sauce was WAAY watery and just flicked all over the place. The pasta seemed a little on the heavy side. The pork was pretty tender...but eh...$20 for this is way way way to much. \n\nMy girlfriend had the bolognese. \""It was good, but tasted like stroganoff\"". I have to agree. The noodles were a little dry. They said it had 6 meats, but you couldn't tell because it was all ground together. $16 for this is also way to much. \n\n$3 basket of bread...bread was good, but waaay over priced.\n\nI think the best part was the non-fried calamari. Very tasty. \n\nThough, we felt a little rushed out the door with our child (who didn't enjoy the experience) as some polite customers decided to take over the place with a party of 8 and 5. \n\nWe wont be going back here. Much better food elsewhere."
1,"i don't use profanity in my reviews, but i cannot find any other words that can express the hot wings.  they are so fucking delicious it's ridiculous.  the chicken wing is cooked well, where it gets crispy and is juicy in the middle.  there is little fat, you you are actually eating a chicken wing.  i pretty much ate everything off the bone.  they have many different kinds of sauce you can select, mild to suicide, honey, bbq, and those sweet flavors with heat for any taste you're in the mood for.  the hot sauce (the step down from suicide) with the wing itself, created the most delicious hot wing i ever had.  it had heat and flavor, without too much of a vinegar taste.  i seriously wanted to lick the plate.  on wednesday their special is 10 wings for $3.00.\n\nthe only reason why i did not give this place 5 stars was because of the bartender.  the drinks were weak.  they use canned juice and red bull instead of the bulk or spout kind, which i appreciate the taste.  i went up to the bar and said i wanted to do a shot.  i am spoiled and don't know the names of any shots (my regular bartenders knows what me and my friends like and will just randomly make stuff that he knows we'll like).  i tell the bartender vodka is ok, no tequila, something that tastes kind of like fruit punch.  she rolls her eyes with her hands on her hips and mentions they don't have any fruit punch.  i mention that the only thing i can remember the name of is the around the world, and she told me you can't make that into a shot.  hahahaha, that's pretty much all i know it as, she was ridiculous.  she made this grape and pineapple juice crap that hardly tasted like booze (i saw her pour, it was pretty much just juice).  aside from her, the server, who was nice, got mine and my friends drink mixed up.  she had a red straw in the one she thought was the raspberry, but the mandarin was made in that glass, so we switched.  when i ran out of my drink, i asked for another mandarin red bull and she brought me a raspberry since the red straw was in it. \n\nthey do karaoke on wednesday and another night i cannot remember.  the selection of songs is great.  there were newer songs.  they had amy winehouse, hot hot heat, panic at the disco, fall out boy, the entire rent soundtrack (which my friend was excited about).  the ones i was amazed to see were teddy geiger, ryan adams, and jeff buckley.  and if that wasn't all... fuck her gently by tenacious d.  my friends and i have wanted to sing this song at our bar forever, they wouldn't even let us sing it a capella.  it was so rad to sing it, it was like some great accomplishment."
-1,"Basically when we took our car in to see if they would look at the issues with our car they responded like a bunch of mindless monkeys with wrenches. Toyota will not take the time to find the solution to what is wrong with your car. Do not buy from Day or Rohrich, they will not care about you or whatever is wrong with your car. Also, their warranties SUCK."
1,"Maybe my standards are low, but I have always loved this place. The company I work for used to hold training classes in Mesa, and I always tried to make it here at least once for each visit. WH is big in the south, and I think AZ is the furthest western location of any WH. Most are just like any fast food, but you get to see the cook, and they have waitresses who step lively between their various chores.\n\nThe last time I was there , the group of co-workers I was with was amazed at the price we paid. I think the most expensive thing was a NY steak for 10 bucks.\n\nIf you like a \""hangover\"" style meal (breakfast anytime, greasy-but-good burgers, etc.) this is the place. And there's thousands of variations to the basic menu.\n\nGrits, hash browns, chili, greasy/good burgers. And folks that look like they should be servin' them to you.\n\nGod, I wish there was one close by, but my health is better for the fact there isn't."
1,"My friends and I have been coming here for about a year; we have dubbed our Tuesdays \""Sushi Tuesdays,\"" and will continue to give patronage for many more years. If you are looking for great food and great service this is the place to come, its like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert. You could go to one of the many run of the mill sushi joints around town but you would be missing out on what life truly has to offer.\n\nAs previous reviews have stated, there are excellent appetizer specials when you purchase a Japanese beer such as fried calamari, chicken yakitori, edemame and of course pot stickers (fried or steamed) for $1.\n\nMy favorite dinner item is the big eye tuna, they cut a piece right behind the cheek or gill of the fish and call it the big eye kama. The meat is extremely tender and ample, like having a steak except incredibly nutritious. The fish is served with a sweet sauce which is delicious and when eaten with Kirin Light it creates a perfect pair, just ask for it you will not be disappointed. Rolls are excellent as well, some of my favorites would be the Cajun wild fish roll or the crunchy eel roll. The sashimi is always made fresh and promptly, the shrimp, salmon and eel are some of the tasty items I enjoy.\n\nThe Bartender Wes keeps everyone quenched and always has positive energy. Management likes to interact with their guests to ensure satisfaction with all orders, which equals great customer service. \n\nThank you Jun, Taki and April."
1,"I am normally not one for buffets, but Sweet Tomatoes came highly recommended by some family members for a healthy place to go have some soup and salad quickly.  We stopped in one night and really liked it.  The homemade soup selection was plentiful and made it hard to decide which one to try.  The salad bar was huge, fresh and a really nice selection of veggies.  There were many options of pizza, pasta, breads and desserts too.  You certainly shouldn't leave this place hungry!"
-1,"I lived in Mozart's Highmont apartment for the past two years. \n\nThe rent is too damn high. It was $730 including utilities when I moved in. If you sign a lease now it's $830. It has hardwood floors... In between the gaping crevices in the floor and splinters galore. The kitchen appliances are 3/4 size so your oven will not accept 11\""X13\"" baking pans and the eyes of your stove are too close to cook more than two items at a time.\n\nThis past winter was very snowy, and Mozart waits until the 23rd hour after snowfall to shovel and salt the walkways, so be prepared to have several near-death experiences getting down the two flights of steep stairs (with short, flimsy, definitely not to code railing). \n\nThey sometimes creep in for inspections, then give you a 'B' without telling you what they didn't like. Aside from inspections, maintenance is really quick for all those pesky problems with the plumbing. The bathtub and sink drip constantly which would be concerning if utilities weren't included. The air conditioning is weak, the heat is hellish and there is very little temperature control since your windows are painted shut.  \n\nThe laundry room is coin operated, it costs $1.75 to wash and to 'dry'. Your clothes will still be soaking wet from the dryer (yes even on high with a clean lint trap). Also be wary of the washers, sometimes people leave them nasty so do a sniff test and a visual inspection before you put your clothes in. The hallways smell like hot garbage, always. They will only be vacuumed shortly after move in in August and right before people start coming to view the apartments in February.\n\nAlso, since the utilities are included, your name isn't on them which means:\n1. When you move on, the utility companies want to say you have no history with them because your name is not on the account.\n2. When Duquesne Light plays with power grid and knocks out your electricity for two days during a 95+ degree heat wave causing misery and spoiling all of your groceries so you are forced to go to the food pantry for months afterward, you can't do anything or be repaid for your losses because of #1. \n\nOne last thing, there is a parking lot, but it costs $75 a month to park back there or you can park on a side street for free and walk 3 blocks with your arms full of groceries. And they will tow you! I was towed within 2 hours after parking back there at (10pm). So park tail-in if you need to use the lot quickly because the tow truck will have to switch equipment to ruin your day.\n\nTL:DR Value for apartment is not great considering all of the other b.s."
1,"They don't do anything fancy but DAMN they do a great job with steaks. great basic meat and potatoes dishes. Food tasted great the warm bread and flavored butter, superb. \nWould get 5 star but the prices seemed a bit high. wish I could go 4.5"
-1,Very bad service. Also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here. Also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked. DO NOT GO TO THIS APPLEBEE's
-1,"I would NEVER suggest that anyone shop for a used vehicle at this Ford dealership.  The used car Sales Manager is lacking character and integrity.  They had a vehicle priced online right at the price we were looking for so we went in to see the vehicle.  It was a very basic, no feature vehicle for a college student.  Once we agreed to purchase it, they came out with a price $1000 higher than what was listed.  The Sales Manager came out and tried to make excuses for a 3rd party company that posts their sales ads and that it was their mistake...we told him it wasn't our issue.  He then proceeded to LIE to us about the costs they put into the vehicle...since they would never put into it more than what it's worth.  This man should not be in the position he's in, as they could have easily made up for their $1K mistake just in the day and should have honored the price they advertised...and to sit and lie to our face?  Get some integrity loser!"
1,"After having a stressful morning with the serpentine belt snapping on my Jeep, going to Inman & Sons made everything better! They were very friendly and honest. The belt was $120 installed which Power Jeep quoted me $210. I chose to go here after reading reviews on Yelp and am sure glad I did. I will be going to Inman from here on out!"
1,"Get the teriyaki mini meal! It has delicious cabbage, AMAZING macaroni salad, & sweet Hawaiian rice. There food is cooked to order so if you're in a hurry you can call ahead"
1,"I've been told for a long time that Tutti Santi was a must-try for authentic Italian food in a romantic setting, and I finally got to try it.\n\nThe Phoenix spot on 16th St. (there are five locations) is indeed romantic, since the restaurant is darkly lit with candles on linen-covered tables, with Italian decorative touches in its paintings covering the walls. The restaurant is divided into three parts-a main dining room, a smaller private area and a small bar area. If you mention you're having a romantic evening, and the place isn't too busy, they might even put you in the smaller room all by yourself, which is thoughtful.\n\nThe service is top-notch. Not only was our server friendly and engaging and made us feel like his main focus, but all the other servers who came to our table were friendly and professional.\n\nWe started with the Mozzarella Caprese ($11.95), which had thick hunks of mozzarella and sliced basil atop thickly covered tomatoes, smothered in diced tomatoes. I've never had a caprese dish where diced tomatoes were on top, but I love tomatoes, so I definitely didn't mind! It also came with some spicy peppers and olives, and all the factors complemented each other well.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Homemade Ravioli alla Nina ($15.95), with ricotta cheese and spinach. I was able to get a combo of the tomato sauce and cheese sauce, and you could really tell the pasta was homemade. It was so delicate and almost melted in your mouth, and the sauces were amazing. I felt like the dish was a little too watery and would have preferred the pasta to have been thicker, but I'd rather have thin homemade pasta over pre-made stuff any day.\n\nMy pal got the special, the orange roughy, which looked and smelled amazing. I really wanted to try it even though I don't eat fish, but the aromas were enough to make me know it was a tasty dish-which he agreed on.\n\nWe of course had to try the tiramisu, my favorite dessert ever. There was so much mascarpone cream in the giant piece of dessert, and it was served very traditionally, covered in cocoa powder. The ladyfingers were soaked heavily, and the cream was amazing. It was a really, really good piece of tiramisu.\n\nBesides the scrumptious food, I loved that Tutti Santi had something for everyone, whether you want a romantic date night, an evening out with a big group or just want to chill at the bar and talk with the bartender. No matter what you go there for, it feels warm and friendly."
1,"I loved this car wash..once I figured out how to get into it (easiest to enter from 44th street).  No Cheesecake Factory menu that takes 20 minutes to read and figure out what the difference is between the $4 wash, the $7 wash, the $12 wash...you get the idea.\n\nI took my husband's vehicle in while he was out of town.  I know, I'm nice like that.  $25 for an SUV complete wash.  This is a true hand wash.  No conveyor belts or automated water squirter things.  Guys with hoses who do a really good job.  They use compressed air to dry, and I watched them go over and over the car to make sure nothing was missed.  I was hard-pressed to find any water streaks.  It can be slow, but it's worth it.\n\nThe only downside is the waiting area is outside (covered), so I don't anticipate his vehicle's next wash until November.  Luckily, my 10 year old vehicle has no aversions to machine washes.  But then again, It would be lucky to get washed before November anyway."
1,"I have been sad wishing the Soup or Salads were still open in our area. I was happy to find this place while out shopping.\n\nThe salad bar is stocked with fresh veggies and add ons. It's clean and inviting. The soup bar, bakery have a nice selection. It can get quite noisy, but I'm here for the food."
1,I placed my order online...and I had no problems picking it up. The girl who helped me was very sweet. \nI was in and out of that place in two minutes. :)
1,"These guys are awesome!  All of the guys in the shop are friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  I was trying to get a spa pump fixed, but I had no clue what was going on.  Even though they could have taken full advantage of my naivety, they didn't, helping me save money every chance they could.  And, the turn around time for rebuilding the motor and pump was incredibly quick.  I will continue to visit Price Busters when I need spa items or help, and I will recommend them to everyone I know."
-1,Since closed.  Surprise surprise.
-1,"Another bad experience two times in a row. There must be a shortage of waitstaff in Charlotte because these people shouldn't even be working at Walmart. Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half. They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana. Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup, waitress looking at me like I was crazy. The manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything I mention I was going to write a bad Yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away. This place used to have a long wait and now there's nobody ever there, now I understand why. Portions are small, service is bad and probably better off going to McDonald's."
1,"Hmm.. I am surprised at the amount of 2 stars with fellow reviewers. Seems sketchy to me.\n\nHere is the deal with Good Fondue:\n\nNot for a family. Yeah, its a romantic type place. Take a date. Or your wife for gods sake. (She likes to go out too!)\n\nExpensive: Yes, in this day and age, good food can still be expensive. Its worth it people. The time it takes to eat an entire meal here is why it costs so much. You take up 2+ hours of their time for 2 to 4 people to eat. They just can't turn tables like your everyday meal type restaurant.\n\nThese meals are meant to be savored. Enjoyed with a good glass of wine, or beverage of your choice. Try to relax here. Enjoy the food, and company most importantly. \n\nThe menu changes a bit from time to time to include a new set of dishes, guessing every 6-8 months. I miss the salad that had heart of palm in it! It was fantastic.\n\nThere is enough variety to actually satisfy 2 different peoples desires in most of their entrees.\n\nDesert, as noted by most everyone on here, is to die for. I have not had one bad desert yet.\n\nThe quick and easy guide to The Melting Pot: Coq au Vin is the baseline cooking that most will love. Traditional Swiss cheese is where \""IT\"" is at. Featured salad is usually a good bet. California salad is a good standby. \n\nDeserts: Try them ALL! Seriously..."
1,"The chipotle eggs benedict was EXCELLENT. If I had a bigger stomach, I would have eaten all of it.  The sauce was amazing, and it had cilantro.\n\nEverything is better with cilantro.\n\nService was good and friendly. \n\nThis place seemed a little more cramped than other locations I've been to.  Getting to the bathroom and getting out of the bathroom here is like an obstacle course."
-1,We'll it's close to my house and all and they do have products but it is the worst in customer service I think I just might start going to sephora down the road but I been here plenty of times and the ladies don't bother asking if you need help or anything . I walked around the store for a good 45 min the store is a bit unorganized --they seem to only help out older ladies 50s and higher but most of them will just be chatting with other employees . They need to do their job and work other than that it's in a great location .
-1,"Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!"
-1,I asked for no onions and pickles but I might as well have asked for a punch in the mouth because I got neither.

-1,"We really wanted to love this place! But the service was so slow and the waitress was slightly preoccupied. Our good wasn't good-order the chili and it was terrible, they did remove it from the bill. The ribs were good though limited side options. \n\nSeems like a good spot for regulars and tebar looked the bar looked relaxing."
-1,"Unfortunately, we had to stay here during the week of Epic's UGM 2013 conference.  \n\nMy room was dirty.  The rooms had a stale, mildew smell.  The shower/tub looked like it had a layer of grime that needed a lot of scrubbing and disinfectant.  \n\nThe few positives about this place are: 1) free HBO; 2) it is located near a handful of restaurants.  \n\nI hope this will be my first and last time staying in an Econo Lodge.  Ugh."
1,"Nice, mellow atmosphere. We had the pear and Pecan salad which was fresh and delicious. The pizza was great--fresh ingredients and arrived hot. Friendly staff."
-1,"This is not the place to go for dinner.  Period.  They have limited evening hours and it's for a good reason.  During the 30 minutes I was there, not a single other soul ventured in.  I think they save the lunch leftovers and schlep them onto the unsuspecting evening customer.\nI can put up with a lot of things for a cheap dinner.  I don't need good customer service.  I don't need to eat in a safe neighborhood.  I'm not expecting gourmet, either.  \nBut, damn it, when you turn the lights off during business hours while I'm in the middle of chomping down my stale pizza, I'm drawing the line.  \nSure, come for lunch.  I'm always a fan of pizza by the slice places, and if my pizza was fresh, I'm sure it would have been good.  Pretty sure, anyways."
1,Love this place! I can't seem to stop ordering the New Mexico Enchiladas each time I go. I really need to branch out but I love them so.
-1,"Everytime I come here they seem to have less and less men's items, specifically designer jeans, which also seem to be getting more and more expensive. \nSelling stuff is a bit different here too. It's consignment so it doesn't quite work the same as Buffalo Exchange where you bring them stuff they take what they want and give you cash or credit on the spot.\nHere, they buy on consignment so they chose the items they want and you get money based on what they sell for AFTER they sell. And they have sales ALL the time it seems.\nLast time I went I sold them 4 pieces and went in today, 3 wks later and nothing sold.\nOf course nothing they took from me was out on the floor. I literally went through every piece. Nothing.\nSeems kinda shady."
-1,I love Pane Bianco--but sadly they have priced me out of their market  for the most part when it comes to sandwiches.  $13 for their tuna sandwich is outrageous--and beyond a price point that I am willing to pay under any  circumstances.  At 9 or even 10 I thought it was reasonably fair and allowed for a tip--at $13  it is not affordable and there is nothing left over for a tip.  I am so sorry that I won't be having lunch there anymore with any kind of frequency.
-1,"I'm not going to lie; I wanted to go to this Denny's solely because of Jetta R.'s review.\n\nBad, bad, bad.  Bad service, bad food, bad experience.  I took my friend here twice to make sure that the first time wasn't just a fluke.  Our waitress was a total space cadet and was completely uninterested in us.  I realize Denny's isn't a high class restaurant, but I do subscribe to the belief that your water glass should never be empty.  We put our glasses at the end of the table.  The waitress flitted around at the tables behind us (there were two, maybe three other tables occupied when we visited, tops), but didn't cater to our needs.  She treated us like children on both visits.  I told my friend, \""the tip meter is running.\""\n\nI wanted to like Jenny's, but it just sucked.  There's no reason for crappy service with a place as empty as it was."
-1,Bad customer service. I went there to exchange something I had bought 1 hour before and if was such a hassle to get mh money back. \nThe guys are very expressive and did not find that professional.
-1,"So I came on here to \""Rag on Red.\"" Looks like a LOT of people beat me to it. After having a great brunch at St. Francis across the parking lot, my boyfriend and I decided to take a peek in. \n\nWell, first of all, I wasn't sure there was anyone there for a while. Which was fine, we just kept looking around and being goofy looking at all the cool old stuff that they have to offer. As we made our way through the store I found who I could only make out as a sales man sitting in front of some lady on a computer. \n\nThey bothered themselves to greet us at that point. Never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit. (I've worked my way through college/law school doing retail, big no-no not greeting customers and making them feel un-welcomed).\n\nSoooo... I was mindlessly walking around the furniture portion of the store when.......GASSSSSPPPP! I tapped on some of the furniture with my finger nail!!! You would have though I had taken a hammer to it with their reaction. I was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything. Whatever.\n\nI was annoyed with them not wanting me to touch anything but alas, its their store, if they don't want people to enjoy their products that's their business. \n\nWhat blew my top was when my boyfriend (who is very friendly and is always interested in what a business has to offer) asked them a question about a chair. An Egg Chair. You would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending. He asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about.  \n\nAnyway, I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air."
1,been coming here for years because I dream of some day completing a full beer tour.  completed some mini tours but not the big one yet.  this place is always giving me store credit for birthdays and other holidays which is just ducky in my book.  food ain't bad but seriously you're coming here for the beer tour.
1,"I know fellow Yelper Sarah L. will try to outdo me on this review, but I say bring it on.\n\nWe arrived to the restaurant @  6:30 which was our reservation time. We had a large group (12) and the table had already been pre-set. I enjoyed that more than seeing servers scurrying around getting tables together, or worse yet, not having the foresight to ensure that there were enough tables for our group. One thing that I did not enjoy about our arrival was the aroma of slightly fermented fish. Although I despise any fish or shellfish in Arizona (save sushi) I thought this place might have higher standards on freshness. Maybe I was smelling their garbage. In any case, my nose did not  get a good first impression.\n\nWe sat down and ordered beverages. I started with a mojito and water. The mojito arrived quickly but the water did not. After 5 minutes, I asked our server if I could have water. He did not seem upset or irritable about my request. He got it quickly and for the rest of the evening, my water was constantly refilled. \n\nThe service was unremarkable. Which is good. If I remember something about the service, it is because they hover, or forget or get too personal. The staff was friendly, helpful and quite professional. \n\nWe had thought about getting tapas but people started ordering tapas as entrees and I wanted to enjoy my entree fully. On the next visit I will grab some. For my meal, I ordered the paradise pulled pork which is Tender, lean pulled pork saut\u00e9ed with onions, sweet peppers, garlic and\nherbs, laced with habanero chiles. Served with black beans and rice. The server remarked good choice. I asked him if he was lying. He said no and I believed him. \n\nAs people started receiving their entrees, I could tell that they liked them. I did not observe one person from our group add any salt or pepper to their dish. That says a lot about the preparation of the dish. Most of us are picky eaters. As for mine, it was very savory, with an excellent initial taste that leaves a garnish of habanero heat on the palette. I would compare the taste of it to many beautiful entree aromas I have smelled in the past, only to be disappointed by the actual taste. At Havana, they were not lacking in the taste department. Just to clarify, it hit my olfactory area and matched up with my tongue readily. The beans were divine, the rice was standard and unremarkable (use previous definition). \n\nThe night starts to wear down. One of the lights outside on the patio is a bit bright. I order coffee. The mug has an antiquity look about it. Not what I expected at a restaurant. The coffee was memorable. It had a good initial taste, not too hot, but felt like water as it washed down my throat. I am less apt to order it again.\n\nDessert came. My mother order the Marquesa de Chocolate a rich and creamy double chocolate pat\u00e9 laced with Grand Marnier and served with whipped cream and toasted walnut (their words). My friend Nicole tasted it and said it was moussy fudge. Although I did not have any, they were quite keen on it. \n\nFellow yelper Sarah L. glared at me all evening. And with good reason. My review will be better than hers. \n\nOverall, the negs were fishy smell and remarkable coffee. Pozs are great food, unremarkable service and decent ambiance."
1,This place is the best for legit Mexican breakfast.  Machaca and Chilaquilles is very good and so is the enchiladas and napolitos.  I have only been for breakfast but can imagine the other food is amazing as well.
-1,Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected.
1,"I think that it is difficult to differentiate between Lexus service centers as they all adhere to to relatively high standards, but I have to say that Bell Lexus is a a pure pleasure to have my car serviced at.  Like most dealerships I was not only able to book my appointment online but also able to get the first time and date I requested.  When you get to the covered service drive, you are always greeted and walked into your service consultant.  I work with Debi at Bell Lexus and she not only gets everything processed and my car in for service quickly but also always has a loaner ready to go.  This time it was a 2010 RX which made the fiancee happy because she is looking at one as her next car possibly.  It gave us the perfect opportunity to drive it around for the morning and see if it was something that we truly liked. I think we are in trouble because we both definitely thought it was a great car for her.  Back to the service though. I had my car in at 8:30 am and I had a call by noon that my 15,000 mile service was not only done but also my brakes had been replace (under warranty) at no extra charge.  I was back in my car (which they also washed) by 1:30 in the afternoon and on my way.  Overall, great service and experience."
1,"Absolutely loved the service here! \nWe brought our truck here after getting hit by another driver, and they were so nice from start, Robert kept in touch to tell us about our truck's progress, they called Hertz for us to get a rental, I will definitely be coming back for future repairs."
-1,"The Eggery is the exact same franchise as the Good Egg down at Park Central, just fussied up with a different name. Exact. Same. Menu. Bleh. Had I known, I would have just taken a stroll through the gayborhood to get to the Good Egg, where there is outdoor seating, the people watching is superior, and the pigeons have balls the size of grape tomatoes.\n\nAlas, the Eggery is the Good Egg's fat, dorky older sister. The service is completely adequate -- nothing horrific, nothing staggering. The food is average, but somehow always arrives cold. At our last visit, there was a metric shit ton of people waiting (including a sweet aging tranny in a muumuu, chartreuse ankle socks, and chunky black heels) but the restaurant proper was only half full, if that. Why? \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be back. There's too many other amazing breakfast places in Phoenix and way too few precious available weekend mornings..."
-1,Z's is better and cheaper
-1,"It's unfortunate their menu only has 4 sandwiches on it. The food was good, albeit leaves a lot to wish for. It came on a plate with a couple olives and nothing else. I would expect more for the $9-11 price tag. \n\nThey market themselves as a sandwich shop but I just don't buy it.  More so, it was a hipster hangout where it seems people go to look cool.  Granted, the few items the did have were quite good, but I just expected a nice turkey sandwich, but that wasn't happening.  \n\nThe service was on the verge of incompetent but the owner did swing by with a loaf of bread.  Too bad we had to ask for oil at the counter to dip it in (our waitress was absent).  \n\nTheir water was unpalatable and they didn't have a lemon, lime, orange or anything wedge to make it slightly less offensive.  My friends that live in Phoenix told me though, this is just the way it is there.   \n\nAll in all, I certainly won't be rushing back but there is plenty of room for positive improvements."
-1,"Disappointed in my attempt at a nail service, yesterday while I was on location they booked me for the following day. Then late this morning, they called to say they double booked and I would have to come in earlier or way later. I understand things happen, but I rearranged my day to schedule the appt. Too bad Ulta!"
-1,"This place was my favorite BBQ in the past. However, now all menu items are smaller, the prices are higher and the sauce is lower quality. I believe smokey Jon can make an award winning sauce but he's not bringing it here. The sides are always top notch the meat is alright but made to be drenched in BBQ, kind of plain alone. All around too expensive for the portion size and used to be a lot higher quality."
1,"First off, I'll admit that this is the only place I'll take my ride too in Down Town Phx. Of course, to be unbiased, that's because its the only place to take your ride too in DT Phx. So, let's be real. 2nd'ly, I drive a Tahoe on big rim's. It's not the easiest thing to clean, and i refuse to do it myself (my own laziness gets a 1 star for car washing, I'm awesome but not THAT awesome). Also, it's black. So double dipper here. The service is fast and friendly, which i love. Danny's needs to take a group field trip here to learn customer service! LO's defiantly has the upper hand in the area. And for the price (i pay about $20 for the works wash every time) it cant be beat and i cant be too sour on it. It's really just minor things; sometimes they forget to wipe out the deep dish rim's thoroughly, or there are minor water spots, or little stains left on the wood grain. Nothing really major, but I just expect perfection every time (which I'm well aware that would only happen if i washed myself, and most likely it wouldn't happen because my ADD would kick in half way through and I would be driving a half dirty half clean whip around town). Also, they have a punch card as well which is very nice! Buy 10, get Numero 11 free. All in All, defiantly 1.5 thumbs up from me; hoping for a full 2 soon."

-1,"Deemos American Grill is a tiny little bar tucked far, far away in the rear (heehee) of the Camelback Esplanade.  In fact, its location is so obscure, I honestly don't know how people stumble upon it.  Deemos is neither interesting nor original; if you do happen to find it, I can't imagine that you would go back.\n\nI, however, did go back.  Let me explain...\n\nFirst, I would like to say that I have been a Deemos patron a handful of times and only on Wednesday nights.  Why Wednesday nights, you might ask?  Well, Wednesday night is karaoke night!\n\nIt all started when a friend of mine called and asked me to go to karaoke with her and of course, I obliged.  I love to tear up a mic every now and then.  I had trouble finding the place (surprise!) and I wasn't terribly impressed when I got there.\n\nThere is a smoking patio outside, so if you're a smoker, that totally rocks.  If you're not a smoker, you may get turned off dodging smoke rings as you walk through the patio to get in the front door.  Inside, there is a U-shaped bar, some high tables, low tables and a couple of booths.  \n\nI'm pretty sure they have a menu, but I've never eaten there and I've never actually seen anyone eating there.  The drink prices aren't great but they aren't really expensive.  I know this because I am a patient person.  The bartenders are awful.  Wait.  Let me tell you what they're good at doing.  They are really good at ignoring you for an exorbitant amount of time, going outside for a 20 minute smoke break, mixing the wrong drink and treating you like they don't really work for tips.\n\nThe ONLY reason I went in the first place and the ONLY reason I went back was the karaoke.  And that's also the reason I gave a 2-star review instead of a 1-star review!\n\nNickstar Entertainment (www.nickstarkaraoke.com) runs the show at Deemos on Wednesday nights from 9pm til 1am.  They are awesome.  They have the biggest selection of songs I've ever seen in my life AND their books are organized.  Their collection is digital.  Their mics are good.  They are fun and genuinely good people.  \n\n\""Dear Nickstar, I am your biggest cheerleader.  You are the only reason Deemos is still in business.  They should thank you... and pay you extra.\""\n\nBut now I have a problem.  I won't be going to Deemos anymore.  Unfortunately, Nickstar is having a censorship problem due to poor management (surprise) and a group of people who have apparently complained about being offended by some of the performances, namely those that incorporate the use of curse words.  \n\nHmmm...  Bar + Drunk People = F-Bombs.  Isn't that a standard people have come to expect?  I can't imagine someone being offended by a couple of curse words IN A BAR.  But apparently, it's become a problem for some and a disappointment to others who enjoy flexing their 1st amendment rights (and their wicked ability to rock a mic).\n\nHonestly, I can't believe that Deemos would sell out like that.  Wait, actually it really doesn't surprise me that much.  The only thing I'm disappointed about is missing out on some great karaoke, but I can catch Nickstar in Tempe (and I will!).\n\nDeemos American Grill, I will never visit your establishment again and I won't miss it.  Shame on you."
1,"We tried this place do to my looking up a place to eat while we were in the area, having our staycation at the Arizona Grand Resort\nHong Kong has to be the best Chinese Buffet I've ever been and I have eaten plenty. Everything was delicious.  We went for dinner so it was 15 and change for adults and our kids were 10 basically.   \n\nThe sushi bar was awesome. Instead of having a chef put out 5 or so different kinds of typical sushi. There is a chef making sushi to order. the menu to order off of is pretty extensive. \n\nMy kids and had quite a few crab legs. The crab legs were also not your typical buffet grade. They were cooked perfectly and the meat was easy to remove and there was a lot of it.\n\nwe didn't try the Mongolian BBq but, we be back."
-1,"Just didn't feel like making dinner tonite, and wanted something quick, yummy and good for me.\n\nI noticed Zoes on my drive home and decided to stop in and check it out. The food was pretty good! I got the grilled chicken platter with a side of rice. I left feeling full (but like the good kind, not the \""on my God I'm gonna pass out\"" kind ;) and satisfied!\n\nI gave it 2 stars because it is kinda generic and there are so many hidden gems to keep an eye out for.\n\n:) Enjoy!"
-1,"I am not really a fan of CPK but I went here with a colleague as it was close by where we were working. I figured I would just go with a basic pizza (thin crust) and was less than impressed. For thin crust it was pretty soggy and for me that is a deal breaker. Service was good and friendly but the pizza sub-par IMO. Maybe the other items are better, but I thought I was safe going with a plain pie."
1,Best Chinese in Phoenix hands down. The hot and spicy prawns are a must and so are the house chow fun noodles.
1,"This is the most fantastically delicious Mexican food I have ever had.\nWe started out with a fish ceviche followed by a shrimp ceviche. My daughter had a sea bass grilled and my son ordered a chille relleno. My wife ordered a carne asada fajita. Then we ordered a Molcajete Caliente for 2. This comes in a stone bowl with green sauce and cheese. It has shrimps, fish, carne asada and chicken. All hung on the hot stone bowl like a shrimp coctail!! Needless to say we all were eating each others food!!\nIt hits your taste buds from every direction!! Yum!!\nWe thought we would finish the meal with a flaan. How wrong we were! We just had to order another one. It was so delicious.\nThe quantity is right up there with the quality. We had to pack up the left overs to go. There is no way I was going to let one ounce of this feast go waste.\nThe service was exceptional. Our hostess/server was there like a genie. Water glasses were filled before they got empty, hot tortias appeared by magic, lime when requested materialised. Even when we awkwardly spilled a glass of water, it was soaked dry with a smile.\nI wish I could have this meal more often.\nI know that every time I come to Phoenix, they will have to deal with me!!  :-) :-)."
-1,"I've been going to this place for the past 15 years and it's definitely gone downhill recently. I used to rave about the food and service to all my friends, but recently my experiences have been pretty terrible. The owner and his waitstaff look as if they have just given up, there's never a smile on anyone's face, they all just look depressed. The food used to be amazing, but it seems as if they must have changed chefs because now everything usually ends up coming out either over done, or just drenched in way too much sauce. If you complain about the food, the waitstaff just acknowledge the complaint with a nod, walk away, and do nothing about it. I hate to write a bad review because I know how great it used to be, but it just seems as if owner stopped caring."
-1,The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life.
1,Great food! Great service! We will be back!
-1,"I have to disagree with these other reviews.  Presbyterian is a joke.  Unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner, and affiliated with Presbyterian as well, and so any time they want to order up something that they can't handle in the office, guess where they send us?\n\nTo make matters worse, the place is always full (or overfull), always understaffed, and always incapable of handling anything.  The emergency department is horrid, but to make matters worse, it's better than being admitted.\n\nIn one of the worst cases of mismanagement ever, what should have been a simple examination - passed from our regular doctor - ended up being at least 12 hours in the emergency room while we waited for a regular room, then several days (yes days) in the hospital itself while they proceeded to run a whopping one test per day.  That's right - one test per day!\n\nThe test would usually be run in mid-morning, and the results would come back mid-afternoon, at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results, which could take until after dinner, and by the time that happened, it would be night time, and then another test would be ordered for the next day.  It was simply pathetic.\n\nWhatever you do, do not go to the emergency room at Presbyterian."
-1,"CVS is pretty standard, right? Pharmacy, overpriced beauty section (but you sure avoid going to Ulta if you can find what you're looking for there), great sales--on booze, on food, stationery, games--whatever. When I lived across the street, I used to come here at night when I was bored and it wasn't busy. Now, though, there are new employees and unfair practices. On more than one occasion, the employees have held sale items for themselves behind the counter. Today, there were no Connect Four on the shelf, but there was one in the cart behind the counter. When the manager was asked about it, she shrugged and pointed at another employee. I've worked in retail before, and this goes against most store policies. \n\nSo, the next time you get a CVS flyer, remember that if it's okay for the employees to shop the sales for themselves here--then it might be happening all over the place. And if they can put one item behind the counter for themselves, then they can put a lot more for their friends. Prepare to be disappointed. Make the extra trip and hit up Wal-Mart."
1,"cheba hut go there when your high, and get even more high off flavor..."
-1,"Ole? \n\nOh no. \n\nI can safely say I tried it, right? They have an extensive menu, reasonably priced lunch specials, and decent salsa, but that's about it. Guacamole that came with my chicken fajitas looked like someone had driven over it with a Mack truck and it didn't taste much better. Chicken was grisly and lacked flavor and the peppers were so over cooked they melted in my mouth. Not in that good melt-in-your-mouth sort of way. In my quest to find the best of the Mex in the Midwest, Laredo's didn't have it. \n\nGot a rec? \n\nLet me know."
1,great flavor\ngreat price\ndont let the 'atmosphere' scare you off
1,"I've known Dr. Lykins socially for several years.  When my allergist told me I needed to see a ENT and that surgery was probably inevitable, I broke my rule of not seeing friends for care or services.   \n\nHe was extremely thorough and went through my CT scans with me to show me what was going on.  He also described in detail what the surgery would entail and what I could expect in regards to recovery.  \n\nThey were able to schedule my surgery relatively quickly which was a relief because I had to be on antibiotics until I could get this procedure done.  \n\nSurgery was yesterday and as far as I can tell, it went great.  My pain levels are surprisingly low (about what they were pre-surgery which is exactly what Dr. Lykins said).  \n\nIt's too soon to tell how successful this will be in addressing the chronic issues I've been having but all in all, the experience was great.  I would highly recommend Dr. Lykins and his staff."
1,"First time customer here. Stopped in and got a pedicure; no waiting. David did my nails and I ordered \""The Works\"" which cost $32.00. Worth.Every.Penny. David did a fantastic job; it was sooo relaxing....would have been perfect if I didn't have to listen to a girl yapping on her cell phone for most of the time but other than that, I was very impressed. The only regret is that I didn't give him a bigger tip (I did tip 20% but he deserved more!!!) Very attentive service, very relaxing, affordable and a nice, clean salon. Highly recommend!!!!"
1,"La Grande Orange is one of those places that I like so much yet due to so many others liking it forces a strain on my ability to like it.\n\nAllow me to explain. Everything on the menu and in the store is a solid quality product. If it is something to be eaten then it is delicious. If it is something to buy and use in some other form or fashion then it is more than likely a great at whatever it is.\n\nThe area where liking La Grande Orange becomes a challenge is that it is always soo overcrowded with customers that the lines and wait for orders can be pretty long. The parking lot is ridiculously small and fills up fast and is almost always full with one or two cars already camping out for a spot.\n\nThat said, my mouth and stomach convince me that this place is just too good to give up on.\n\nI have been living in Dallas, TX most recently and have thought about how nice it would be to have a La Grande Orange out here. With all of the people recently relocating to the Dallas area maybe those who run LGO should consider placing a location out here."
1,I took 4 watches to be repaired & it was only $8 per watch. This place is family owned and has awesome speedy service.  I was in and out in 10 mins!
-1,"I moved here in Aug. found these apts in a hurry. HUGH MISTAKE!!!! They have \""lost my security deposit\""!!!!! Say they never received it,although I have copies of payment!!!! Lease has me listed in wrong apt. Is on 3rd manager since August!!!! Mallory, girl who was sooo helpful @ move in says she can't remember !!!! The carpet is NASTY, there are roaches, grounds are unkept. They don't fix problems...... The biggest thing is they lost the money !!!!!! Run,don't walk from this place!!!!! Biggest mistake I ever made!!!!! Karen"
1,I tagged along on my husband's business trip. The room was clean and the bedroom was separate which is a plus. Flat screen tv in each room another plus. Uber comfy bed...BIG plus\n\nWe asked for a crib for our infant and the guy that brought it was super nice. Had dinner at the restaurant downstairs. The food was decent enough - we went mainly  for convenience. Our dinner waitress was super nice and was really helpful.\n\nNext time my husband has to come to town again I don't think I'd mind coming along again.
1,I've only eaten here twice but each time the food was awesome and the staff was courteous.  The price is about average for the portions of the food but it is well worth it.  I have only eaten breakfast here so I can not speak for the rest of the menu but I will definitely go back when I have the chance.
1,"This is my new favorite morning coffee place!  Lots of tables, free wifi, short lines, and great food too.  The Mexicana coffee here is my personal favorite.  Breakfast burritos are good too.  This location seems to have a lot of competition in the area (McDonalds, Starbucks, Einsteins, America's, etc)  but it is by far the best place to sit and relax."
-1,"My first and only experience (to date) with George and Dragon was not very pleasant. When you walk in you are magically whisked away to an all-too-authentic British pub. That's great if what you are after is smelling like an ashtray after a meal of Shepherd's Pie. \n\nThe waitress that served me seemed a little brusque. Maybe that's part of the restaurant's \""charm\""?  The bathroom was in a transitory state of disrepair... or at least I hope it was transitory. I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be in there.\n\nTelevisions are available for watching the soccer match and they have many types of beer on tap. I noticed a jukebox but didn't turn it on for fear of being pummeled severely by the other gruff-looking patrons while the soccer match was on.\n\nThis place has a little bit of an edge to it. If that's what you're into and you're just looking for a spot to grab a beer with a buddy, then check it out for sure. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back again, personally."
-1,"I hate to agree with the other poor reviews of this branch, but this is definitely far from the best Eagle in the city. I'll say upfront that I never felt unsafe the three times that I have been here. However, the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor. The lines are always long and take forever to get through. Furthermore, the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par. I'd recommend stopping in another Giant Eagle if you can. However, this location DOES have a Redbox, which is nice."
-1,"Absolutely horrible place! Snakes was treated like pieces of shit, and we WILL NOT stand for it! The manager is a complete asshole and doesnt give a shit if you have a good time or not, as long as he gets his money. Completely unprofessional and neither myself, or any of my friends will ever set foot in this hell hole of a place ever again."
-1,"If you are an audiophile, then stay away   FAR AWAY.!!!   I brought in a Luxman hybrid amp because of some parasitic noise that I thought was due to a dirty volume pot.  After they replaced 5 capacitors for about 175.00, ( WHY??)  I took it home and guess what , it made NO difference whatsoever.  So I brought it back.. Here is where the problems really began  Martin, ( you are a total DICK) was so rude I thought I was getting punked.    I hope to all that is holy you go out of business soon.    My amp is still not fixed.  I am out 175.00.  And I do not want to go back there to face this very very rude individual.  He was even rude to my wife, who by the way is the sweetest person I know. (I have to say that).  I am sorry our paths crossed at all!!   By the way, even if you are not an audiophile, but simply a decent human being I still advise you stay away...far away."
-1,"Stopped in here for lunch on our first day in Phoenix.\n\nIce cold Corona's at $4 a pop. Nice.\n\nA bowl of fresh and warm nacho chips with two types of salsa was served with the menus. Nice.\n\nMy other half had the shrimp cocktail. She said she liked it. Nice.\n\nI had the shrimp with a butter/lemon sauce that came with a salad, rice and beans, and a flour tortilla. It tasted great, but they lose a star because they did not deshell any of the shrimp. Not nice......"
-1,"Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9 used to be a wonderful restaurant. I don't know what's going on there now, but they appear to be having problems retaining good staff. Unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent. \n\nSpicy Curry Beef Linguine used to be a favorite; it was mildly spicy and had delicious curry flavor. Now, it's too spicy to eat, all from jalapeno peppers, and meanwhile the curry sauce has turned into a vague, bland gravy with no curry subtlety. \n\nMeals come with free, fresh baked bread, which is nice. The owners briefly experimented by removing the free bread offering, but it returned a couple weeks later due to customer complaint. Lesson: don't remove the niceties your customers have come to expect from you. \n\nThe service here used to be fabulous; now it is mediocre on a good day and terrible on a bad day. You will be held hostage for your check. Your waiter will come ask \""is everything alright?\"" before you have taken your first bite of food and then never return to see if you need anything else, avoiding all attempts at eye contact."
1,"This is \""my place\""- if you come to town, we eat here. If you want to grab a drink, we'll go here! We even spent one horribly drunken New Year's Eve partying it up with the Rock Bottom crew. This would normally be a 5-star review but I feel like their service has gone downhill a bit in the last 6 months and this could stand to be addressed.\n\nFirst of all, you cannot beat Happy Hour! As a beer snob, I often feel left out when the Happy Hour specials only include America's favorite urine-colored watered down drinks. Occasionally I can get a Sam Adam's or Blue Moon, but it's nothing to match. The specials here vary by the day but you'll be able to get a pint of beer or a mixed drink for around $3- sign up for their free Mug Club and you'll get 20oz mugs every time too! There's a patio with smoking on one side only- it's great to sit out there most of the year but does get packed close to the weekends. \n\nThe food specials at Happy Hour beat the oh-so-cheap yet mediocre Applebee's standard. Most appetizers are $3- a few items, such as sliders, show up just for happy hour and aren't even on the regular menu. There is a burger they offer for $5, and you can get a bucket of fries or kettle chips for $1.50. The sliders are my favorite (both chicken and beef), and i'd also recommend kettle chips, the spinach artichoke dip, or the nachos. \n\nThe beers could almost use their own review- there are 6 or 7 to try and account for what people like to drink. There is usually a special seasonal beer along with a cask-conditioned option. As I mentioned before, the best way to drink beer is with a Mug Club card. You'll get a 20oz mug for the 16oz price and accumulate points towards things such as logo pint glasses. If you like the urine-variety of mass-produced beers, try a Dreamcatcher. If you enjoy good flavor, try the El Jefe Hefeweizen, Desert Trail Pale Ale, or Raptor Red. At this location in particular I think the El Jefe is the best. \n\nThe food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost everything on the menu. The standouts are the Mac N' Chicken, the Lemon Chicken, the Smoked Salmon Fish and Chips, and the Prime Rib (they run specials on this at various times of the year). A lot of entrees come with the wonderful White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the vegetables you are served are pretty flavorful. Definitely good enough to deserve coming here even if you don't drink beer.\n\nMy only complaints lately are that the service has gone downhill. We've been several times in the past few months- 3 times for happy hour and once for dinner. One time at happy hour was perfect, the second our food came out and had clearly been sitting around (coagulated cheese skin on top of the artichoke dip), and the third the food had only sat a tiny bit but it took us forever to get the attention of our waitress. The time we went for dinner the food was good, but it took a long time and didn't come out all at once. If the restaurant can resolve this, it'll earn its 5th star."
-1,"Way overpriced for just ok food.  On a Tuesday night, there was a long wait.  The staff wasn't overly friendly, and when we had to wait, they simply pointed towards the wine bar.  Having never been there before, I was confused by having to pass through the outside to get to the bar.  While I thought the wine bar was cozy, the other customers there were rude and self-centered, ignoring polite \""excuse me\"" by the waitstaff.   When we were finally seated, we waited about 10 minutes before a server appeared.  The food was prompt, and the salad was more than enough to share.  The pizza was simply ok.  I've had much better wood-fired pizza elsewhere.\n\nBeware:  for just a party of five, they added a 20% tip onto the bill.  If you're going to add a tip to a bill, make it the customary 18%.  But frankly, I didn't think they needed to add the tip for us.  Also, do not use multiple credit cards.  I was charged for the entire bill on my card, even though we asked to split it between two.  I'm still waiting for my overpayment to be refunded by the restaurant..."
-1,"I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."
1,"Well, some dishes are good and some dishes are not so good.  Portions on the small side compared with ACE and Mekong Palace a mile north.  3 1/2 rounded up to 4."
1,"What can I say, I love Marshalls. This location is clean and always filled with a ton of great finds. My only complaint (hence the 4 stars) is that they don't have a jewelry counter. I came here to find a cute necklace for my boyfriend's mother for her birthday. NOTHING like that in this store. I settled on a cute tank for myself, but still left with no present for her. \n\nOverall, if you;re a fan of Marshalls, you'll be a fan of this location."
-1,"Chico's Tacos is kind of the queenly sister of the chain Mexican restaurants peppered around Phoenix like so many grains of sand in your swimsuit. It is clearly several steps up from your local generic Mexican drive through, but it's still just not tasty.\n\nThis fact does not dissuade me from visiting Chico's on a semi-kinda-regular basis - it is close to my work, and the wait is generally minimal.  Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical \""lunch rush\"" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.\n\nA quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called. \n\nIf you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.\n\nI have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican \""grilled\"" platter, or the entree includes \""grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual \""crunch\""? This is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in. Doused in copious amount of salsa, it's not too bad, but I can't imagine straight-up muching on it without that extra step of preparation.\n\nThe rice is good. I can't comment on the beans, because I don't eat them!\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is cute - much nicer than your usual chain, reflete with wooden parrots and brightly-colored tiles. Something about the inside of the building makes it very loud inside at lunchtime - not a spot to sit and bring a book and contemplate the mysteries of and the reality of your newly found adulthood...not that I've, you know, tried that...or anything..."
-1,"So my bf and I wanted a drink and snacks since it was happy hour at 2 we went and we were in a bit of a hurry cause my bf had to go to work at 3 so it just turned 2 so we weren't really in a rush since we THOUGHT they would give us our meal in 5 min NOPE we pull up,press the red button it lights up......nothing we do it again...nothing. People next to is pulled up and ordered already. So we back out and go into another menu same thing waited about 2 min then they finally answered I asked is one of you menu broken? They said nope. So I told them what happens and we been waiting for 5-8 mins for someone to answer then they said o yeah one of the menus is broken. So I'm like alright and we ordered room about 15 min till our order came and that's when we were in a rush. Another time my bf ordered chili cheese fries they gave him what looked/tasted like plastic cold cheese fries and my strawberry limeade had way to many strawberry chunks in it I felt like I didn't even drunk anything mostly ate the strawberries and could really taste some syrup Idk it was too sweet! They need to retrain or idk but they been messing up a lot. Not gonna go here again"
1,"After spending time at IKEA and Linen N Things, we went mattress shopping. Not the most exciting piece of furniture in the house. Well, not until you get it home...wink, wink! The showroom is a sea of off white cushy rectangular sleeping slabs. Everything looks the same. Try this one. How 'bout this one. This, is our premier mattress. Really? My backside must be numb (insert joke here), cuz they all kinda felt the same. When the salesperson told me I was lying on a $2,200 mattress, I sprang from the bed as if I'd heard some clatter and got outta bed to see what was the matter. We settled on a less expensive version and have been peacefully sleeping ever since. Well. Except for my freight train snoring apparently. But I'll yelp about that later. The salesperson was a good sport as The Culinary Comedian and his fashion designer boyfriend were cracking up and cracking jokes as we lay, man to man, on beds all over the showroom. Plenty of eyes wandered our way when we attempted to spoon each other. You gotta test it out. That's what the salesperson said. Finally, after a day of spending thousands of dollars you get that final pre sign on the dot question. Mattress cover for $99? Uh, no. Thanks though. Well if you spill or tear it or a meteor lands on it, the warranty is null and void. Still,  no. But thank you. It also prevents bed bugs and bed mites. SOLD! You should have mentioned that first buster. Sleep America. Where Gay America (and you other people) Go To Sleep!"
1,"We had a great dinner at Omaha Steakhouse.  The filets were awesome!  The service was outstanding also.\n\n\nTony and Jean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nWe noticed that you recently dined at Omaha Steakhouse after making a reservation on Yelp. What'd you think of the restaurant?

-1,Not many menu choices but we both ordered the chicken fried steak & could have shared one plate. We both had half our plates left over. That would have been nice to know ahead of time. The bread they serve before dinner is ok; it kept the kids occupied until the food came. The food we ordered was ok but I don't think we will be back. Slow waiter service as well.
-1,"While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.  \n\nWhen my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\n\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \n\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \n\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!"
-1,"Really bland tasting food, and annoying atmosphere, as well as annoying staff. The food has nothing unique about it. I wish the fries were good so \""bottomless fries\"" meant something to me. The table we sat at was REALLY close to another table (there is a row of crammed tables) and the people next to us were eavesdropping the entire time. Quite uncomfortable, but the only seating available. They brought out an entirely wrong burger to me, but gave me a $20 giftcard since they messed up, so that was cool."
1,"Review in Haiku:\n\nOld folks congregate,\n\nin this dark, hole in the wall,\n\njukebox plays oldies.\n\nP.S.- I really like the Swizz."
-1,"I used to love Panera but as the years have gone by their standards of both food and service has declined greatly. It's a gamble if you are going to get good food and service or if the D team is working that day and they serve cold soup and sandwiches that look like Stevie Wonder  made them. I have to be deserate now to go there, like travelling on the Ohio turnpike and my other rest stop options are burger king and popeyes. Coprorate needs to improve and manage  their quality control,training, and processes. It's like they came out with a bang and now are just coasting."
1,Annie's Pet Parlor has always impressed us.  They are kind and gentle.  We plan ahead so paying with cash has never been a problem.
-1,"Just like the rest of downtown Phoenix, this place was dead. Our server was slow, taking 10 to 15 minutes to bring out our drinks. The food was okay, but nothing to write to my Yelp friends about. If you can find somewhere else in downtown PHX, I recommend you give it a try before ending up at this place."
-1,"I have really good food here in the past (try eggplant rolatini) and the local bread is fantastic. Tonight, however, was just awful. Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be \""homemade\"" but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn't take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn't repeated."
1,"Been using the Dutch Girls dry cleaning and sewing services for a few years now and they have never let me down!  Personal, professional and timely service every time!  Sure there is cheaper places to go, but if good service is what you need they are your girls!"
-1,"Seriously the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Service is always slow. I'm currently sitting in the parking lot right now with about 4 other cars from the drive thru that are waiting for food. If I could read my receipt (printer must be low on ink), I'd call the corporate office and tell them to fire the whole place and start over."
-1,"$10 cover, no hats, and they steal your ID.  How is this garbage still in business???"
1,"They make a decent pizza with ample toppings and a chewy crust. Better, their sauce is sweet!"
-1,After paying to park at the weak excuse of a mall that this place is located in we figured we might as well at least try to get our parking moneys worth so we stopped in and ordered up a couple margaritas to ease the pain of being bamboozled. I've definitely had better drinks and I've definitely had worse. Can't speak for the food here but I definitely wouldn't be running back for happy hour or any other hour for that matter to throw one back.
1,"Nice airport.  Way too big.  I had to go from A27 to B27 to make my connection, and I had to book through the half-mile terminal a la OJ Simpson from the old Hertz commercials... leaping over luggage trucks, weaving my way through baby strollers, high-fiving the janitorial staff and heismanning the people from Southwest who wanted me to sign up for their credit card.  If you understood this analogy and remember this commercial, then you too, my friend, are getting old like me."
-1,"This Caterer entirely ruined my sisters wedding yesterday.  For a small 50 person wedding, the cost was ridiculous and even though they paid their bill in FULL months before the wedding, the caterer was still asking for money up until the day of the event.  The Basic Cake clause in the contract was not explained well.  The catering staff kept asking the family all night for a schedule of things even though it had been provided to them by the bride weeks earlier.  They even cut the cake before the bridal couple cut the cake and were serving it during the toast!  \n\nThe food was cold, the displays were well done although very sparse, there was no butter provided for the rolls, salt and pepper was not provided and when asked for, was told that having salt and pepper available would be an insult to the chef.\n\nThe staff was supposed to be at the hall at 2:30 PM and didn't show up until after the guests started arriving at 3:45 for a 4 PM wedding.\n\nShameful, shameful.  I will never use this caterer again nor will I recommend it to any of my clients or businesses I do business with."
-1,"Goon alert!\n\nFood was once again, not terrible, but not what I ordered. (What's with this? Nothing on the menu is complicated, why can't you deliver what was ordered?)\n\nHowever, when I tried to get the attention of my waiter I was accosted by a goon.\n\nThe guy tells me he is the manager, but he acted like a goon. Came up to the table, did not identify himself as being part of the establishment and growled \""Waddya want?\""  \n\nHe got angry and slammed away when I asked him who he was.\n\nThe waiter is a really nice guy and hampered by a kitchen that seems to never quite get it right. But where it is usually at least passable, the manager pushed them over to total failure."
1,I just wanted to give my two cent. I have been going to dawn studio for years. I like the fact that Dawn studio  is a small business phoenix az owned good for the economy..all of us. I like the classes I feel I get a great workout everytime. I do wish they had classes wtih the cool air..but then it would be call Hot Yoga..lol. I also would like to see more pilates classes. \nI met Dawn when she still had a regular job and a weight problem she has taught me more about staying focus working hard to getting in shape since she know what it take to keep it together. I would recommend Dawn classes in a heartbeat.!
1,"Great happy hour food and good drink specials. Try the Firecracker shrimp appetizer and Huckleberry Margarita, really good!!!\nGood idea after hiking Camelback mountain....\nFriendly, pleasant staff."
-1,"As a lifelong Pittsburgher, I've been to Tambellini's enough times over the years -- and I think it's still open simply because of it's location practically next door to the Benedum, and patrons who go there aren't the regular theater-goers.  I was invited to go with friends, who were old enough to remember when it was probably good.\nThe prices are *outrageously* high for the quality of the food and portions.  I had the Chicken Marsala, which was alright, but something I normally eat served out of a chafing dish at a funeral buffet. This was comparable to a catered version and the restaurant itself deserves a funeral... It's outdated and just a factory for getting people in and out and on time to the cultural events they're going to.\nThe waitress was nice enough, seemed a bit embarrassed to respond 'no' when I asked if certain menu items were fresh.  On the other hand, she disappeared quite a bit and didn't ask if we wanted any desserts -- which we probably would've if we'd been asked.\nEven though Downtown after business hours isn't the most exciting place to eat, there are other places I'll insist on going instead of back to Tambellini's."
-1,"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch."
-1,"I wish we could have met under better circumstances but the moment I walked into your establishment I wanted to vomit.  It reeked of sweaty gym socks and vinegar and there was no room at the bar.\n\nMaybe I will come back with \""What Odor?\"" in hand and we can have a fresh beginning."
1,The food is great & the service is even better.  \n\nI highly recommend this place.
-1,"Stopped for an early dinner with my wife,she wanted to try the two for twenty special.\nAs soon as we told the server what we wanted the service went downhill. We did not order any alcohol and we were having the special so this was not going to be a big check for the server but restaruant was not busy so any check should be better than no check.  Used the kiosk to pay for meal since i couldn't get the server to come back to check on us.Discount did not show up on kiosk I shouls have been  more aware since i had heard a similar comment from another table when we came in. Server said not to worry that the amount was correct. I pushed for reciept showing what was actually being charged to ny card. server said she needed my card and would have to talk to the manager. Finally got my paper reciept with correct charges but kiosk on table showed the over charge and had not adjusted. My wife thought we were going to be billed twice for the same meal, so she has been watching the debit card account.\nThis incident killed my night and the weekend with my wife constantly checking the bank account. This incident is all that my has been talking about to her friends all weekend long, I am sure that this will continue once she gets to work tomorrow."
1,"CPK catered our playgroup event, and what a terrific job they did!  Their people were charming and all the food was delicious, especially the linguine, the Thai chicken pizzas, and the wild field greens salad with candied nuts."
-1,"Definitely overpriced for what they offered.  Took my car in to check my AC, they didn't get back to me for the whole day, and decided to fix whatever the problem was without asking me and charging me an insane about (approximately $150 more than most places).  Definitely will not go back there again."
1,"This is the resort course for the Pointe Tapatio Cliffs Hilton.  \n\nNot an easy trek by any stretch of the imagination, but nevertheless a playable course for virtually anyone.  Desert golf is great in that low-index golfers can be challenged by the requirement to play target golf.  High handicap or newer golfers should enjoy the fact that the desert conditions make it very easy to find errantly hit balls and place them back in the fairway.  (Don't try to hit off the desert dirt unless you hate your clubs.)\n\nThere are a couple difficult forced carries but as long as you pick the correct tee box, they are all manageable.  Course conditions are always immaculate.  (I've probably played here 20 times over the past 5 years.)  The greens fees are a little on the high side, but then again this is resort golf and that is to be expected.\n\nMy only complaint is the service.  The guys who work the carts need to grow up and act a little more mature.  I get tired of standing there watching towel fights or two guys arguing over who can hit a golf ball farther.  I don't know why, but this seems to have gotten worse in the past year."
1,"Definitely a must-try! The building itself isn't much to look at but the parking lot is always full and that's a great indication of yummy-ness. It caters to both meat and veggie eaters with fake chicken, duck, and beef plates. They also have mock seafood plates as well. \n\nMy friend and I went to check this place out because we had heard so much about it. She ordered the lemon grass chicken and I tried the ginger duck. Both were so tasty and we were kinda freaked out because they tasted just like the real thing. The service was excellent and kudos for the waitress who kept filling up our waters...even AFTER we paid the bill. It's reasonably priced and the food portions are perfect. We even had leftovers."
-1,"The upstairs theater is nice enough. There are a few nice semi-upscale restaurants here. It's also got a really good swanky (and somewhat hidden) bar here. \n\nSo why only 2 stars? Well, because it smells like this is where all the diarrhea in the world goes to die... especially the parking structure. If you can escape the smell though, this is a nice spot for a date. The problem with that is when you go walk her to her car, you have to try and figure out how to have a good night kiss while your nose is telling your brain that you are swimming in a septic tank.\n\nThe new Waterfront mall corridor stinks like this as well. Maybe that's where the term \""filthy rich\"" comes from. What do these people eat?"
-1,"If i could give China Chili less than one star, I would.\n\nFriends keep dragging me there because it is walking distance from their offices.  If they keep insisting on China Chili, i might have to show up too late to get lunch. I have never had a good meal there. The worst was mushu that tasted like the vegetables in it were canned."
-1,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I drove 40 minutes out of my way to have one of these great green chile burritos...I was at least expecting pulled beef, not beef squares.  The sauce was decent, had a good kick, but there was wayyy too much of it with no chips to eat it with? SHAME on them for no chips and salsa!!!!! For $8 there was very little amount of beef inside swimming in green chile sauce-How did they get all that green chile sauce to stay in there!? We ate it on the picnic tables outside in the 107 degree heat while we got bitten by ants.  It's a pretty sketchy neighborhood, so I would make this a lunch time experience if you must try it for yourself.  Come packin' some heat if you don't want to end up like 'boys in da hood' LOL"
-1,"So, I don't know WHY we decided to stop into this sports bar for some lunch during our Charlotte trip, oh wait, yes I do remember. It's because we were starving to death and sick of walking in the 100 degree weather. \n\nAnyway, I still regret stopping in as I'm sure there are a million better places in the area to go. The service was terrible, granted we think the guy may have been new, but it was overall awkward and just odd. I don't really want a side of 'uncomfortable' with my mushroom swiss burger. (I also don't want to be asked what kind of cheese I want on my mushroom SWISS burger). \n\nPricing was a little high, food was decent, service was pretty bad but more than anything I'm just mad at myself that I didn't do a bit more research. Definitely should have found a local lunch gem that would have satisfied my appetite and need for a great cultural experience. There's always next time."
1,"I'd have to say this is one of my favorite airports to connect though.  I've never been delayed and the food selection during layovers is decent - I recommend the burrito place. I enjoy the free wifi a lot too.\n\nThere is a shuttle that goes to the metro that will take your downtown.  It's easy to use and cheap.  I highly recommend it.\n\nThat being said, when you are flying out of PHX - give yourself LOTS of time if you have a rental car to return.  Like 2 hours to park the car at the rental place, get on the shuttle, and get over to the terminal.  I didn't give myself enough time and missed the cut off for my flight by like ten minutes and wound up with a PHX-LAS-CLT-IND red eye instead of my PHX-IND flight that I was supposed to be on. i'm still bitter about it."
-1,"After reading the other reviews, my friend and I went to try this out wanting good Tex-Mex. I was surprised how mediocre it was. I had the enchiladas (my typical go-to dish at Tex-Mex restaurants) and just found them very ordinary. Even the margarita just wasn't that flavorful. After having some other Mexican that was outstanding places like Milagro Grill earlier in the week, this was not up to par."
-1,"This is nothing disparaging about the food. The food is quite tasty and exceptional. However, the service was less than stellar. I waited 10 minutes for my dessert and another 15-20 for my check, and my water was not refilled once. It was impossible to get anyone's attention to get service which is enough to put me off and not want to come back. Personally, I don't pay good money to wait on a server, I pay to get waited on. That may make me a snot but it's what I expect when I go to a restaurant."
1,"I haven't been to many airports in my life, so of the few that I've been to, Sky Harbor is one of the better ones. And here's why: outlet stations. If you have any kind of electronic device that sometimes acts as an extra appendage, you can appreciate the sight of a row of outlets in an airport. I can't tell you how many times I've arrived at the airport, realized my cell battery was low and panicked at the thought of my phone dying before take off and not having any buffer to airplane small talk.\n\nSky Harbor is clean and efficient with helpful signage as airport signage should be. I think I've always flown out of B or C gate and the food options are pretty good-better than your standard airport cuisine. Of course the prices are airport-appropriate (see: highway robbery), but should you be stuck there for an extended period of time, the eats won't be limited to mystery meat from the golden arches. Pretty much every restaurant I saw had a bar which is great for those of us with air travel anxiety. \n\nI don't mind stopping through Sky Harbor and should I get stuck there, I think it's one of the better airports to get stuck in."
1,"Fate is a great downtown spot. The servers are down-to-earth, the food is great, and best of all, it's open late! The lack of late-night joints in this city is horribly depressing.\n\nIt's sad to read other reviews of Fate being such an awful place. True, they do take reservations which can cause some trouble with people who just walk in. Those of you who complain about having to wait outside, look at what you are dining in - a house! It's not the most spacious restaurant and if it is busy, they certainly do not have room for people to crowd the place. If there is a long wait, again - a house! There are no more than a few tables. \n\nAs far as the service goes, it is excellent. The servers are extremely down-to-earth and knowledgable. The food is great, too - I recommend the Fried Tofu Wedges (well, the tofu in general), the Pad Thai, and the Hot and Sour soup. They also have fried rice, which is awesome with shrimp. \n\nAll in all Fate is a great place. Make reservations, grab a couple close friends, check out their awesome beer list, and you're guaranteed to have a great experience."
-1,Vanilla porter and root beer pretty tasty. Rest of the beers below par.  For the price food wasn't that great either. Wouldn't come back here again
-1,"Preferred Parking's rates are way too high.  We're parking in Charlotte, people, not San Francisco.  They actually want to charge me around $140/month to park in the lot near my building.  Are you kidding me?  That's what it cost to park in Chicago (and I used to work downtown).  I'm not sure if some people's companies subsidize their parking and that's why they are willing to support these crazy rates, but it just boggles my mind.  \n\nIn addition to their bad prices, their customer service is abysmal.  \nI used them for awhile when I first moved to Charlotte (parking far away from my workspace, so I could actually afford it).  But, abruptly, Preferred Parking sold the lot I parked in, never gave me any notice but did call me right before the transfer and rudely told me to find somewhere else to park.  More confusion ensued, and I ended up severing all ties with them and found another company's lot to park in. It's even further away, but worth it to no longer have to deal with Preferred Parking's bad prices and bad customer service."
-1,Decent price on domestic pitchers. Entrees were half off but all looked mediocre. Tried the jambalaya and it was so so. Big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service.
-1,"Tried to go, they were closed an hour early with employees outside drinking. Not impressed."
1,"Helpful staff, good selection and healthy plants. My second favorite nursery and one that I frequent often."
1,I love Trader Joe's! I really like picking up unique food items at great prices! Everything has been delicious! The hummus and pita chip snack two pack is really a steal for a healthy and yummy snack! I also love the large selection of cheeses!
1,I love this place the lava taco is amazing and the carmel empenadas are a good treat.
1,"My blackberry wouldn't charge due to a loose mini USB port. I had just 2 bars left for power and it's my only phone so sending it out was not an option. It was out of warranty and I don't carry insurance on my phone. I called Sun Cellar and he quoted me a price and a wait time of 20-25min. I looked around at other repair centers and found their quotes to be 2x as much and they didn't have a tech in until the afternoon and told me it would take an hour or more.\n\nI got there and was helped right away. The repair took 10minutes (if that!). Dan was polite, pleasant, and very knowledgeable. The cost was exactly the price he quoted me on the phone. I am so grateful that he was able to help me out. The repair cost less than my deductible would have cost with insurance, certainly a fraction of what a new phone cost, and he had me operational in 10 minutes! I couldn't ask for better service!\n\nI would certainly recommend this business to anyone needing cell phone repair and will use them again!"
1,"I was surprised at how good the food was at this tiny place. I normally avoid the \""hole-in-the-wall\"" type places, but I decided to give this one a try and SO happy I did. The food was well priced and not too greasy. The ingredients taste fresh and it has that family owned feeling."
1,I sat at the outdoor bar under a straw rooftop and the March breeze cooled down the Phoenix 90-degree March heat and I truly felt like I was in Hawaii. The margaritas were S-T-R-O-N-G and the crowd was lively and fun!
-1,"Non attentive staff, VERY rude bartender. Left before getting waited on!"
1,"If you love spicy food this is the place for you. I always feel like a get great service everytime I come. I bring my family often because We always enjoys the food, spirits, and service."
1,"This is my second time here and I like it. The service was quick, delightful and considerate. They were busy for lunch and it took a while to get our rolls. The food was tasty and just enough to fill our tummies."
1,C section was very empty when we fly out on a Monday night. Security lined moved quickly and it's a pretty clean airport. The water from the filter water refill station tasted salty and gross though.
1,"I love family owned restaurants and will gladly try any place that isn't a franchise.  I was very surprised to go in on a Saturday morning and the place was bustling with activity and lots of diners, all of whom looked to be regulars and quite happy with their morning blintz or eggs.  I ordered a pumperdine bagel with lox, cream cheese and onions and it was top notch and piled high with lox.  Delicious.  Love the deli pickles, very authentic, not your normal over vinegared store brand.  \n\nI would love to go back soon, after seeing their list of smoked fish...I love a good deli with fish choices and I can't wait to also try a corned beef sandwich."
1,"Tucked away into an old central (and scary) neighbourhood, it was a bit hard  to find in the dark. Glad we did, though!\nGot a lemonade (made with fresh lemon juice), the fried chicken with cheese biscuit sandwich and split an order of bacon cheddar fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy outer breading, thick and juicy meat inside. The biscuit was really tasty and flaky. It came with a few cubes of watermelon but I don't like melon so those went untouched. \nWe sat inside at the bar and everyone working inside was super nice and friendly. They have quite a few regulars and I could see why. The prices were a bit higher than I expected but they use totally local sourced ingredients and everything is prepared fresh so you're paying for the quality just as much as the quantity. \nAn order of cheddar bacon fries, a biscuit chicken sandwich with watermelon side, lemonade, and tip totalled to just over $21."
1,"After three visits I am hooked! Great little place. I tried this place because of a local dines deal and now keep going back. Two time everything was 100% perfect. This last time the bread on my meatball sub was just a little hard, actually really hard but the meatballs are so good that I overlooked it! I have had the lasagna which was very flavorful and lots of cheese and sauce. The appetizers are great as well as the pasta fagiolli. The canolli is a great choice for dessert. Service is always friendly and fast. Food hot and fresh. The place is small but worth the wait. The owner was asking everyone how their meals were. Nice to see him involved and taking care of customers."
1,"Again , my favorite breakfast place!!! I soo look forward to my Saturday mornings!   If it \"" ain't \"" broke don't fix it!  Lol."
1,Great food. I have never been disappointed.
-1,"We love Greek food and have eaten it all over the world - including Greece....  This wasn't all that impressive.  First clue should have been that the place was virtually empty on a Saturday night....  Calamari was mediocre - definitely had much better elsewhere.  We can make Tzatziki that is equivalent or better in quality.  Moussaka was a huge disappointment - dry, undercooked eggplant...  Best dish was marinated swordfish - but definitely not worth $18..."
1,"One of the only pizza places I get really excited to visit. It has a lot of Italian-American food...calzones, lasagna, strombolis, and they're all freaking delicious.\n\nMy favorite is the mouthwatering double-deckeroni pizza. Double pepperoni, a spicy pizza sauce, and an awesome cheese blend that sends my taste buds straight to heaven, arteries be damned. For the purists out there: Yes, we know it's not *really* Chicago style, but who cares when it's this tasty? You can always get the thin crust.\n\nThey also have an extensive beer selection. They boast 110 brews, and you can take a \""world tour\"" of beer. Basically, you can record every drink you order on a membership card, and when that's done, you get your very own witty one-liner on a plaque in the waiting area. Really cool concept, but I offer some criticisms--too many of the beers are stuff we've already had. Do I really have to drink one more of the same domestic drafts to make it? What a chore. There's another list for the various martinis they have, but unfortunately those are hit or miss.\n\nThis is a great place to stuff your face, get a nice buzz, and watch the game. Shout out to the waitress that introduced me to Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. She gave this review just enough of a boost to give it four stars."
-1,"Prepare to be wowed. \n\nHigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \""Gar\u00e7on\"" I asked, \""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence."
-1,"Okay, I have lived in Phoenix and in LA. I have always thought LA was more expensive until my experience at Maroney's Cleaners. Holy Crap Ohla!!! I paid $7.65 for a pair of lined pants to get cleaned by them. Now, I have paid anywhere from $1.50 to $5.50 but are you kidding me $7.65. Then to top it off...I was a bit disappointed in the actual dry cleaning service because my pants were not perfect!!! So, after I was done throwing a temper-tantrum in the tahoe I then proceeded to call and text everyone I know (okay just kidding) about my frustrations. The drive up service is convenient however the price is NOT WORTH IT!!!"
-1,"I have traveled all over this wonderful country and stayed in many hotels.  This easily ranks among the worst.  The staff is rude, the room has a weird stench if the AC is not on, and the \""breakfast buffet\"" in the morning is a regimented affair with coffee canisters empty or spitting some weird, vaguely brown, lukewarm liquid. The staff will thrust a bag with unidentified contents at you if you do not wish to stay in the dirty, cluttered eating area, and tell you this is what you are \""allowed\"" to take.  \n\nClearly this establishment benefits mightily from its location, so if there is a hotelier out there reading this I suggest you look into Madison as a likely place to put a comfortable inn.  I am sure I am not the only one who would take advantage of such a alternative."
-1,"I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood."
-1,"We have dined at this chain for over 20 years. It was one of our favorites. Well bubba, those days are long gone. Ate at the one nearest us in Savannah and noticed the flavor and quality of my dinner (Pasta Rustica) was not up to par. Server said the new owners are all about the bottom line and are changing the recipes. Hello new owners; this is a recipe for disaster. \""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"" \n\nDecided to give them one more shot. Big mistake pigboy! The Carbonna was horrible, and that is as kind as I can get. Do they have a corporate taste kitchen? It was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat. A poached egg on top? Not the way to do it. Egg is an integral part of the recipe, not an add-on to pretend this is breakfast too. I tried to eat it but simply could not; even after dousing it with olive oil. There was no sauce; no moisture. Besides, the egg pasta was too thick. \n\nServer did a good job. I asked to speak to the manager. She was gracious and, to her credit, comped my dinner and gave us a free desert. Class act. \n\nBut that was the last time. If you have patronized this place over the years before it was sold, you can now forget them. Do not waste your money."
-1,"This was awful.  Base on the reviews from this site we decided to check it out.  I reallly wanted to like it, it's close to home, has awesome architecture, great outside seating and good atmosphere.  Howerver that's when the good times stopped.  The chips showed up and were so stale they had to have been out of the bag since early last week.  The salsa was not tasty at all and the sour cream came in cafeteria packets or \""in baked potato packets from Golden Corrall\"" as Jessie says.\n\nWhen the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips.  Jessie will eat just about any Mexican food on the planet but this was TERRIBLE.  I haven't a clue what other people enjoyed, maybe we managed t order the two things on the menu that are awful.\n\nTo top it all off there weren't any entertaining people in the whole place to pay attention to.  Just unacceptable.  \n\nNeedless to say we will not be visiting the Fiesta Cafe again, unless there is a Fiesta with lots of free booze."
1,"I'm from east coast and I'm trying to find the owner to let me allow this place in my strip mall this food is truely a touch of its own will hit every tasty bud....please understand!!!!!!!!''''''''you will leave leave happy and talking about\""I wish I was their neighbor\""'''! This spot will leave its mark....watch our in n out burger....be worried if people know what they are !!!"
1,"I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!"
-1,"I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today, half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entr\u00e9e too, but at least it was edible.)\n\nI finally think I'm done with this place."
-1,"Recently purchased a car here. Thought it would be decent, due to average reviews and featured on an app I downloaded for recommended dealers. By far not the best experience. They will tell you what you want to hear during the dealing process, and then make all sorts of excuses not to follow through with promises. \n\nHave had issues with the car, drivers window quit working, so they told us to let the guy who was replacing the windshield know. We did, the guy fixed it, we were on our way. \n\nCame time to make our first payment, which they told us wasn't due for another two weeks, and then a few days later was supposedly due and late, and informed us that we owe them now for the drivers side window. And since we were late, it \""threw up red flags\"" for them. Really?! So not coming through on your cheap little 500 mile warranty didn't throw up \""red flags\"" for us as consumers? Whatever.  \n\nThese people are very shady. Do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you. They are money sharks and will not help you whatsoever in good faith. Shop around and stay away from them. The only reason we didn't give the car back is the 1000 dollars we had already paid. We are just going to go to our regular mechanic now, and deal with them as less as possible.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, the car blew a head gasket a month after we bought it. They want $2600 to fix it, and will not do anything in good faith. Waste of a lot of money $1700 to be exact (down payment, first month worth of payments and all the towing)... Words of advise...STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. There are way better dealers in the valley that will help you. We now have to save up for another down payment for a different car. They can eat s**t."
1,Great lunch specials! The best green tea ever! Love this place. Always great fast service.
-1,Party of One deal keeps getting more expensive.  Salad tastes like it was bought from Food Lion.\n\nPizza is what you'd expect.
-1,"I was very specific when I made my reservations several months ago. I needed a non-entrance level room away from noise. We were given a room right off of the hotel Foyer. It is mid-night and a party rages just outside my door even though I have called the front desk asking for their assistance. Right now I would prefer to be in a Motel6.  This room was relatively not cheap, it should have at least been cut-rate given out only as a last resort.  The next time I am in Pittsburgh it will not include a stay at The Priory, which is a shame because besides this issue it is a nice place. But if you are considering staying at this hotel why take the chance. While the party continues and I am getting no help from the front desk I am tempted to lower my rating to a single star. But, hey, I can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night."
-1,"This is just an average place. Its not bad. \nParking is free, small lot but street parking around the area is possible.\nWent there for brunch. \nHippy looking teenage waitress was patronizing, Couldn't serve me a side of bacon with my Bloody Mary before my entree for whatever reason. \nBiscuit was dry, really nothing special. \nSalmon hash was average and not very many salmon pieces, mostly potatoes and onion. It was tasty none the less. Quantity was less than average. \nBacon was just like what they serve at my hospital cafeteria, nothing special. \nThere was a 25 minute wait which is always expected at a good brunch place. \nBloody Mary was average as well. \n\nWhen I think of brunch I expect a quantity and quality as I am combining both meals. Here Quantity was slightly less than average, and quality was average. \n\n\n\nNoise level- Noisy, \n\nThey take cards including AMEX\n\nHave no idea why this place is so popular. Probably people haven't been to Original pancake house, much better service and far better food and cheaper too (they take only cash)"
-1,"I've had better burgers at several other Pittsburgh restaurants. I have never eaten anything else on the Tessaro menu--and since it doesn't look very appealing, it's not likely that I will--but the burgers are just OK. The service, in my opinion, is often quite rude. The \""ambiance\"" is loud, dark, dingy and depressing. Sorry, but I just don't get it. For a better hamburger, try the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium, Murray Avenue Grill, or even Five Guys Burgers and Fries."
-1,"I used to frequent Le Peep. It's reliable food, but nothing great or special. The food doesn't have too much flavor to it, and if you get over that, it's decent.\n\nThe last time I went, I only wanted to go because I had a free meal to redeem from the punch cards they have. Now, I had two different cards with punches that both added up to a full card. You would think that they could add those two cards together to redeem my meal. However, when I was at the stand to redeem the card, the host wouldn't let me because the punches were on two separate cards. She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said \""SEE ID.\"" So, she asked me, \""Do you want me to look at your ID?\"" I answered no. She asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid. I'm pretty sure that asking that question defeats the purpose of writing that in the signature line. I'm not one to even care if people check my ID, but phrasing a question like that just showed the ignorance of the employees at this restaurant.\n\nThe servers have always been nice, it's just the hosts (and manager I believe) that were incredibly disappointing. I won't be returning."
1,"Super cool location.  Food was good, not great.  Service was very good"
-1,12/11    Most unreliable WiFi in town. The manager will look you straight in the eye and lie to you about a cut antenna but I've tested with multiple devices and times/dates and know this isn't true.\n\n1/12     STILL the most unreliable WiFi in town! Does zero good to complain. Obvious they could care less.
-1,"Well, it does get one from point A to point B in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut it's expensive, at least compared to the Metro Transit in Minneapolis that I'm used to. On Port Authority, it's $2.25 for a ticket, and an extra $1 for a transfer (which only gets you on one more bus, not all the way to your destination if it requires a bunch of transfers.) Coming from a maximum of $3 for two and a half hours of bus rides (express bus during rush hour), Port Authority is steep. I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.\n\nThere's no day pass. Boo. If you're traveling a lot throughout the day, it adds up fast without some sort of pass.\n\nAlso, the 28X doesn't pick up passengers coming from downtown into Oakland (or drop them off in the reverse direction.) Very frustrating, especially with a Megabus terminal only three blocks away from one of the stops. (There's also Greyhound and Amtrak downtown, if I remember correctly.)"
1,"This isn't your average shaved ice place. It is AMAZING. My favorite summer treat and it makes great leftovers too! There's so many flavor options and you're always met with friendly staff. They even have options for people who are sugar free which is great. The ice is shaved super finely, unlike anywhere else. It's kind of like eating flavored freshly fallen snow. It can be enjoyed any time of the year, but it is particularly good after a day in the heat. I recommend wedding cake Bahama Rama mama with creme!"
-1,"I haven't been to the Getaway in a few years, and now I remember why.  Aside from my hubby, who got a burger and fries, we were all rather underwhelmed with our dishes.  Once upon a time this place used to be really good.  Now not so much."
-1,"What happened to this place. I have not been here like a year, and everything went down the hill. No more banana bread\n\nFirst, Bad Service. We stood up for 5 minutes in front of main door while inside was not crowded. Waiter did not bring us a bread. i had to ask twice. Order was slow. I saw our food waited in the counter at least 10 minutes. I was ready to go and pick it up.\n\nSushi quality was bad. Yakisoba noodle was burned.\n\nWell, I used to go this place alot, but I will never go back again. What happened to Japanese culture - Being fast , efficent and respectful ?\n\nI will never come back, there are lots of nice places in nort phoenix. just go check it out like Tokyo lobby, yen sushi. It will worth a drive, and \n\nSAYANORA Cherry Blossom"
-1,"I should preface this by saying this wasn't my pick, and not really my kind of place.  That being said, it's a decent conventional style restaurant and not bad for what it is. \n\nI had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy.  The boiled red skinned potatoes were pretty much what you'd expect boiled red skinned potatoes to be, and they come with melted butter on the side in case you'd really like to pack an artery.  This is definitely not a meal for anyone worried about TMAO.\n\nI don't want to be too hard on the place because, you know, it is what it is, and for what it is, it's not that bad, not that good, just ok; something like that.  \n\nNow, I just wonder how long that burger is going to remain in my gut.  I think I can feel the bacteria burping away in there right about now... Ugh."
1,"Excellent, really great place. Really awesome vermicelli bowls. Ignore any reviews that are under five stars."
-1,"Visited this location on 2/27 with a friend for Lobsterfest. I ordered the Lobster in Paradise.. The lobster was NOT fresh, it was tough and very chewy. I was really bummed out by this because I was really looking forward to trying this dish and I don't normally have any complaints about Red Lobster. The service was excellent, our waiter was very friendly and attentive."
-1,"We just went here last night because of charlotte restaurant week and wanting to try a different upscale restaurant.  The experience was nothing close to nice or upscale.  We arrived and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess, A+ to the hostesses.\n\nIt took some minutes before our waiter came to us, friendly, but slow.  Kevin and I both ordered our appetizers, meal, and dessert all at once, along with a drink from the bar.  Kevin ordered soup and I ordered a salad.  Kevins soup came, no salad for me.  The server came by with bread and did not say a thing.  My salad finally arrives.  A few minutes later the server returns and mentions she is glad to see that I have my salad now and was wondering what happened to it.  Both the soup and the salad were good, but to eat starters separately should not happen.  After finishing, I finally get my bar drink, the server appologizes for it taking so long.\n\nNext to courses.  Kevin had lobster pasta and I had steak.  My steak was dropped off, but no steak knife was dropped off by our waiter, the person who dropped off the food, or anyone.  Waiter no where in sight, I flag down someone for a steak knife.  Aside from that, the steak was good, had a nice flavor.  Kevin liked his, but did not think it was anything special.\n\nWe finish the main course and are waiting around for some time, our waiter comes by and asks us if we want boxes, we say yes.  A couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts. He asked us of we were still working on our dinners, suprised to see them on the table.  We told him we were waiting on boxes.  He takes them away to box them.  A few minutes later our waiter comes with boxes, and is surprised to see our food gone.  Aside from that, the desserts were good.  The chocolate cake was rich, but great!\n\nOverall, I was not blown away by the food, and since the service and experience was awful, I will not be back.  If I'm going to pay a lot of money for dinner, it should all be great.  It was just like going to a mediocre restaurant, felt nothing like an upscale restaurant."
-1,"I stayed here with my fiance for a night a couple of Saturdays ago.  Upon entering the hotel we noticed that they had won a single diamond star 2010 and my fiance followed up with that by asking what has happened since then.  The lobby of the hotel seemed to be pretty nice and check in was quick and easy.  Our room was on the second floor and upon entering I was surprised at how small it was.  It reminded me of hotels over in Europe and barely had room to move around in.  We weren't planning on spending much time in the room and so I didn't pay much attention to it.  I guess that I should have paid more attention to the name of the hotel though as that could have been a clue.  As we were leaving the room and headed toward the elevator we noticed a vending machine that was probably 90% empty.  Odd but it seemed to fit with the rest of the dingy decor of the place.  After we got back to the place and my fiance climbed onto the bed it immediately sunk down pretty far.  Not a good thing.  In the morning we ended up checking out early and skipping the free breakfast as we were happy to get out of there.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't stay here again in the future.  Yes, this place is cheap but I would rather pay the extra money and stay somewhere else that feels cleaner and has some more room."
-1,"Was driving by Madison and thought we'd get some BBQ.  I had the spicy chicken, which was just a chicken breast on a bun, with sauce on the side.  That was it, not even a big chicken breast? \n\nMy wife had the turkey sandwich, which didn't appear to be anything special either.  It looked like it was from a grocery store.\n\nKids liked the burger and brats.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the prices, sandwich platters were $8.45 each and drinks were $1.99 each.  Wasted my money on these as they don't give you a drink you can take with you and it's a plastic cup.  \n\nWhat I did like was the sides, except for the one order of fried biscuit, which was raw in the middle.  Threw them out.\n\nLast, I've never been to a BBQ place with no sauces on the table and only one served with the order.  I liked the sauce, but with all of the awards on the wall, they should offer a few options. \n\nShould have gotten the pulled pork."
1,"Went here because it was the only place I could find listed on Yelp. \nDemitialia's recent experience was on target. \n\nMy Jean d'Eve had stopped working while in storage and I took it in to get the battery changed. The proprietor glanced at my wrist and recognized my vintage Accutron and said, \""Hmm... nice. Collectors' watch...\"" After opening the Jd'E, turns out the battery ihad corroded. He removed the battery and the corrosion, blew the crud out of the watch with canned air, oiled the works, replaced the battery closed it up, and set the time. $5.00.\n\nI asked about a new band. \""Lizzard or Crocodile? Maybe plain?\"" He had a very nice selection of bands in various styles. I chose a crocodile. He threw in new spindles, no charge. $20.\n\nWe began talking about New York. Turns out he worked on 47th Street (the Diamond District). We traded a few stories about living in NYC. Nice guy.\n\nHe looked down and noticed that the Jean d'Eve had lost time. Took the whole thing apart again. More air. More oil. \""Bring it back if it acts up.\""\n\nTwo hours later. I'm back. He replaces the circuit board. No Charge. More air. More oil. \""Looks like the corrosion may have gotten into the works... but let's see.\"" Tells me if the watch continues to loose time, he'll have to operate.  \n\nFive hours later, the watch seems to be keeping time. I'm a happy man!"
1,Great place! I went in for a tire pressure check. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes and was given a bottle of water. FREE! Great service nice employees I come here for all tire stuff. :)  thanks Discount Tire Guys.
1,"Green Chili Burrito Enchilada style.  They only make a few items, it's in da hood, and there is a line of people in suits out front every time I go. \n\nJust one drawback, and it's no surprise, they take cash only.  That just sucks cuz sometimes I want to stop even when I don't have cash in my pocket.  Also, I think the hours are somewhat limited to just lunch.  \n\nRito's is a WIN."
1,"Yum! The food at all Oregano's is always delicious and I'd have to say the same about this location. Both the food and service is good here. It is very consistent with other locations.\n\nIt also is consistent with most other locations in parking - or lack there of. Unfortunately, this is just something you have to take with most locations.\n\nOtherwise, great place to go! You can usually get two meals out of your entree, too!"
1,"Recent family lunch at the Duck, outside under the amazing eucalyptus trees, had more great sandwiches.  It's so easy to get a really layered and yummy vegetarian sandwich with great side treats.  And the meat-a-tarians in the family loved their sandwiches too!"
-1,"Avoid this place.  Its super loud, and the weird seating gimmick is a nightmare.  Food was nothing better than average."
-1,"I this is your idea of good BBQ, you obviously don't know anything about what good BBQ should taste like.  I saw one review that suggested you eat the meat with the sides - looking for flavor I guess.  Lame attempt at sauce, ho hum buns.  I think the only reason they've lasted is that this town doesn't seem to have much competition in the BBQ department."
-1,"We drove to the LoLo's downtown location from basically the 51 and Shea to find that it closed at 7. From there, we drove up Grand to Town Talk II, which sadly, also closed at 7. We had a chat with the owner who told us that the closest place for barbecue was Honey Bear's, even though he said that he didn't want to see us leave.\nIt was about a 5 minute drive from there. Once we arrived, we ordered. I got the ribs and two nasty side items that came with it. The fountain drink machine didn't have Coke or Pepsi products, but had R-C Cola products. The selection was interesting, but I found it unique and somewhat cool.\nAnyway, my plate had six or seven ribs drenched in a too-sweet barbecue sauce. The ribs had almost no meat on them.\nI don't know, maybe I asked for the wrong food or something, but I was highly disappointed in Honey Bear's. I do admit, however, that the televisions showing the NBA Finals did help a bit. I don't think I'll come back. I've also learned a valuable lesson: for the most part, restaurants in Downtown Phoenix close at 7."
-1,"I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \""mistake\"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at."
-1,"Everything about this place was mediocre. The food was mediocre, the ambiance was mediocre and the service was mediocre."
-1,"Nice people, but when you take in 3 pairs of $150 jeans to have them shortened and they say yes we can keep the original hem apparently they think that means to cut off the original hem and stitch the alteration as close to they originally looked as possible. Everywhere else in the world that's called matching the stitch (which is usually cheaper) but not keeping the hem. Two totally different things and matching stitching isn't worth $10 per alteration. One last thing, they didn't even match the thread color and width well. Original is a faded yellow and they used a shiny bright yellow. Looks totally sloppy.\n\nThey refused a refund and said they would fix it at the same price with the actual hem... If we went through a box of a ton of alterations scraps and matched it. Total scam artists. Too bad cash was paid or they would be getting a challenge from my credit card. \n\nI found them by yelp and hopefully other people consider this review before giving these dishonest business people any money."
1,"Organized, clean, and I know I can always find something I like there.  Every-time I consign I always sell something within a week and can count on store credit.  Very reputable.  Great spot to shop during lunch from work, and the ladies are always real helpful."
-1,"HORRIBLE customer service! (Not the waitress). The food was warm, had little flavor, and a simple menu item that read differently from what was expected was not offered to be negotiated. From where I'm from, when something reads \""smoked turkey\"" you are expecting just that, not smoked turkey sausage (round slices of a turkey sausage). Even when given the pass of a misunderstanding, the manager (owerners daughter as she so often identify herself) was more interested in making HER point than making sure out of state customers who went out of their way to visit the establishment....and checked-in on Facebook have an enjoyable experience. She was sarcastic & unprofessional. Sorry my family had THAT experience."
1,"Pretty good Korean food.... IMO.\n\nI lived in Korea Town, Los Angeles for a few years and would walk to our local souju spots and our local Korean BBQ spots with great frequency, so I ate a lot of Korean food.  This place is about as good as the Hodori in Los Angeles, which I would rate 3 stars, but this place gets 4 being in the middle of the desert with little else to compare.  Hodori, LA is literally surrounded by 100 other KBBQ spots.\n\nAnyway, service is whatever..... nothing special, which is to be expected at a Korean establishment.  Sides are pretty good and they are good about refilling them.\n\nTwo of us usually share one bbq dish and are perfectly full at the end after devouring the meal with all the sides.  Oh, and a good boba spot is right next door... kbbq then boba, ftw!"
1,I wanted to say the staff and Dr. Martins are the top of their field!  I would trust them any day with my four legged babies!!!  Gismo and Lady love them all!
1,"In the first two days of discovering Croque... I had eaten there twice. While I've been looking for new places to eat in the area, this one quickly sucked me in. On the second day, I also got two co-workers to eat there, and I think this is quickly becoming a Croque office.\n\nI've now had a number of their sandwiches, including their bugolki sandwich (on multi-grain with the garlic spread) and the chicken pesto club (on white with their remoulade) and both are absolutely delicious. Very different sandwiches, but each is great in its own right. Unwrapping these sandwiches alone is enough to get you salivating. The scent is irresistible! Add fresh, quality ingredients hand assembled while you wait, and you've got a winner. I was even eating some of the remoulade straight out of the side container they gave me, that's how good this stuff is!\n\nI also tried out their teriyaki chicken lunch bowl... YUM!\n\nMatter of fact, I'm getting hungry again just writing this..."
-1,"Until recently I have been a long time patron of what may have been the finest Chinese eating establishment in Arizona. There were many memories made here. I moved away several years ago which made it difficult to get back to one of my all time favorite restaurants. Recently between appointments I found myself at lunch time both hungry and near this landmark. I was unaware of the ownership change until I walked in and was not greeted by familiar or friendly service. \n\nSince I was on limited time I ordered from the lunch menu expecting the the same service as I had been accustomed. Wrong. The order was taken in reasonable time but the food arrived luke warm almost 35 minutes later as I was preparing to leave. The lunch special wasn't very special and bordered on disgusting. Running late for my appointment, I had to track down staff so that I could get a guest check and pay my bill. I can say that both service and food quality were consistent: SUB PAR. It is unlikely I will return."
1,"My husband and I went here to create our baby shower registery a few months back and were pleasantly suprised by how easy they make it for you. The woman at the desk was very friendly and helpful. This is our first child so we had no idea what we were doing! After being signed up, we were provided with a scanner, a map of the store and a checklist for must have items. The store is set up in lettered sections which makes it easy to find what you're looking for in such a large store. There is always a staff member around the corner that is eager to answer any questions you may have. \nThey also made it very easy to return things that we received, even without a receipt! They just loaded the value onto a gift card. Also, if you make your registry here... after your shower they will give you 15% off everything that is still on your registry!  They also have a great rewards program and you get coupons printed on your receipt every time you shop here!\nThe reason I give 4 stars is because they are a little pricey..."
1,"Eastwind is back in my good graces. The whole fried rice thing was fixed. You can now order half portions of their delicious fried rice, including veggie fried rice! Which leaves room for all their other delectable morsels.\n\nAnd they have liquor now! Woohoo! I had already ordered my sake bomber before I read that on the menu so I didn't get a chance to order a cocktail. They should create a cocktail menu and throw some cocktail specials on their happy hour menu. (Hint, hint).\n\nA few changes to their menu and food, but all good ones! Still great service as well."
-1,"When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place."
-1,AWFUL!! i booked a hotel room here for New Years Eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room! 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before I was staying there my credit card was charged for the room!  I was treated like an idiot by Carmen who answered the phone.  She kept saying that I should have known but I would not have been so upset if I had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted!!  Make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room!!  Would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way I have been treated!!!
-1,"The associates are slow and rude. One time I ordered a bacon ranch salad with ranch dressing, got home, they gave me some north western I don't even know what it was crap. Go back ask politely for a packet of salad ranch dressing, because \""you gave me the wrong one I requested\"". She says \""what kind of dressing did we give you?\"" I said \""ma'am idk it was not ranch though\"" so she tries to give me ranch dipping sauce and the manager finally hands me the dressing I want. I just felt like I was being questioned. I do not need free packets of dressing, but I do want the kind I ordered. On several occasions before and after this incident I have experienced slow service, incorrect orders given to me, and extremely poor customer service. They should have people with some decency working there. I know it's McDonalds but as Si would say, good-NESS!"
-1,This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.
-1,"How very disappointing to take a Massachusetts guest to the Phoenix Zoo only to find that 6 of their 11 Encounters, Tours and Experiences were closed. They did tell us one was closed but failed to mention the other 5. Be sure to contact them before you go! Even the seasonal (yes, summer items) were closed."
1,"New in town, I had heard nothing but good things about Mama Java's, so since I live half a mile up 36th, I decided to walk down and try it for myself. I walked in and was immediately introduced to a warm, welcoming atmosphere. A very popular place, there were many people, and there was still ample seating. As I approached the counter, I had asked a friendly employee what they would recommend. As soon as she had asked if I liked chocolate, I quickly nodded in confirmation. I didn't have to wait very long for preparation of my soy mocha, which tasted truly outstanding. I highly recommend Mama Java's Coffee House, it's very well worth the price...SO much better than commercially owned coffee houses like Starbucks."
1,Never disappoints back for another commuter sandwich this morning on my way home from airport.  Looks like they have a new rotisserie going to have to stop back for dinner sometime\n\nNice to sit out side and enjoy our beautiful Arizona weather
1,I love this place!  It's on my short list of places to make sure to take visitors.  I always get the bruschetta and there are so many different options to choose from it never gets old.  One of favorites in the valley.
-1,"On name alone we HAD to check this place out, just for kicks.\n\nOuch!\n\nBandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way. And you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measure.\n\nI've got no qualms with talent, don't get me wrong; the female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form. A woman is a woman is a beautiful woman, and I'm a sucker. By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.\n\nThe squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under a tacky illuminated \""Bandaids Show Lounge\"" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with \""damn, I'mma get mugged out here\"" uncertainty and darkness.\n\nOnce inside (yes, you go in through a sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar while another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat down - *sub-standard: the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed \""no sideways caps, no baggy/saggy jeans, no long tees\"" dress code posted by the door should have been a red flag. Classy!\n\nAfter getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really, really good-looking - hottest girl on staff, setting false precedent for what the stage talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next to, the center stage.\n\nMost of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, mostly empty on a Friday night...\n... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way.\n... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, more amply-bossomed strippers.\n... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.\n\nGirl after girl (a couple of \""a'ight\"" girls, most \""everyday\"" girls, and at least one \""is that a girl?\"" girls) came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music - some exhibiting-gymnast calibre pole skills and limberness - then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection \""...would you like a dance?  ...would you like a dance?\"" propositioning. Sales Basics 101: Always Be Closing, right?\n\nNone of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbie-esque dancers who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.\n\nAfter a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of \""meh\"" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it...\n...the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire...\n...the summation of the Bandaids experience...\n...that's when we saw it... \n\n...The HOOD-KINI*!\n\nIt was time to leave... quickly. As we braved the parking lot,  it was joke after FirstAid-alluding and Infectious-disease related joke. Automatic hilarity at the mere mention during the rest of our trip.\n\n\""Band-Aids\"", because correlating \""possibility of infection\"" and adult entertainment is savvy business sense.\n____________________\nYes, yes.  A hooded bikini.\nIn black and neon. A hood to obscure her face, while thin straps and patches of material covered her naughty bits.  A. Hooded.  Bikini.  If she were gonna take your money, she might as well look the part."
-1,"$9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry, I thought I was in Pittsburgh, not New York City. Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \""Paradise City\"" with the rest of the crowd."
-1,"Let's start with what I like about Dandelion since I don't think they're TERRIBLE (Yelp says 2 stars is for a \""Meh\"" review):\nIt smells nice, they have the incense I like.\nTheir hours are more reasonable than Carrie's.\nMy fiance got some amazing pants there.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nTheir size selection is terrible, I'm plus sized and I can rarely find anything that would fit. This is a very common problem and I know they're not contractually obligated to buy my size, but I would spend $40 on a dress they bought for $2 from Goodwill if they had it!\nTheir organization. Organizing by color... why? WHY? \nSome of their clothes are literally falling apart and still marked at full price."
-1,"I recently stayed here through Priceline. I was pretty disappointed. It was overall not nearly as clean as you'd expect it and furthermore what appeared to be the manager at the front desk was berating a woman who appeared to be a new hire in front of the customers. I felt terrible for this woman. Just a terrible presentation overall and if I had a choice, I wouldn't go back."
-1,"My mom wanted to go here for lunch last Friday & I was actually kinda excited, because it's been a few years since I last came here. Parking was a bitch & that was a task in itself! Any way, we made our way back to the hostess stand & was told there would be a 30 minute wait. For lunch, really?! We decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait. \n\nLindsey was our server & she was so sweet, checked on us often too. For starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip. I forgot how big the portions are, what were we thinking ordering 2 apps?! The boom dip was yummy but the calamari was just ok, way too much breading/coating! For our entree we decided to split the 14\"" aunt margherita pizza (thin crust) & added artichokes. My mom only had a bite since she ate a lot of the apps, I had a slice & it was ok. Pretty bland in flavor, barely any cheese & the crust had a similar texture to cardboard. I took the leftovers home & my hubby agreed, he wasn't diggin the pizza either. \n\nTotal (not including tip) was about $40. While the food was just ok the service was great! I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years, because I know I've had good food here in the past. I think next time I need to order some pasta & definitely the pizza cookie!"
1,"You know I have to say I haven't had a really bad experience here. I have always been able to check in, check my bags and get through security within the span of an hour. The people haven't been rude, they certainly haven't had that down home charm but hey we are almost on the west coast...what do you expect.\n\nIts easy to get to and travel through on multiple airlines.\n\nNo complaints!"
-1,"This place is way overrated!!! They let ur car sit for 5-10 minutes before they even start to dry it.  By this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time.  Their armor all has gone down as well.  They used to have the best tire gloss that would last for 10 days, now they use a cheaper brand that's dull.  This place has really gone down over the years.  Again, way overrated.  30 second vacuum pfffff"
1,"I went down to Phoenix for Spring Training and ran across this place in the middle of no where.   Waffle in the name of the joint and I love breakfast food so why not?\n\nWent in there first thing I saw was a Lamborghini outside the Waffle House, and my friends claimed they just saw Amare going into it.  I was too slow to confirm this nor could i get a camera out so oh wells, but if rich people will eat here, why not an average joe like me?\n\nThe place is a bit small, I wouldn't bring a group of 5 or more since none of the table can be together.   The wait wasn't horribly long, about 5-10 mins.  When we sat down the waitress was prompt with the menu and gave us some time to order which is rare in a quick serving food joint that's packed.\n\nI got the Special which consist of a giant waffle, 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and 3 bacon/sausages for 8 bucks.   You order this with the warm syrup and bam instant gratification.    \n\n1 star for the food, 1 for the service, 1 for cleanliness (for a diner setting), 1 ease of parking/location"
-1,"I was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute WORST place I've ever eaten at. \n-hair in the food\n-crab cakes were touted as amazing, in reality disgusting ice cream scoops of poor crab and mayonnaise \n-\""risotto\"" uncooked and congealed to plate. \n-vegetables gummy and soaked in oil. Not properly prepped and served with woody stems. \n\nI was shocked this place turns a profit"
1,Def one of the better if  not my best of the East Valley. The owners are very welcoming and its a nice quiet place. I'm a huge fan of fried rice and sweet and sour and they do both very well. I love the chips in the beginning and who doesn't love ending a meal with a fried banana delicious bite!! MMmmmmm Enjoy
1,"Don't let the seedy location fool ya, this place is the bomb, serving up some of the most authentic Mexican I've ever tasted.\n\nYour experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.\n\nAs you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. \nThis should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. \n\nTheir chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.\n\nEvery item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. \n\nWhat I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. \n\nHere's my suggestion.\nGo on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.\n\nThe food, ambiance, service are all superb. \nThis is the place where I take out-of towner's when they say they want 'real' Mexican food. \nThis is also the place where your butt-hole will curse you the next day if you don't listen to him and ease up on the salsa."
-1,"Went here because of Man vs Food.  Nice place to have a Beer and watch sports or just hang out.  But, the food, that is another story.  My daughter had the fish tacos.  They where like Libby TV dinner style fish sticks no taste.  My wife had the Cheeseburger, again no taste and not any better that a Bob's Big boy burger.  I had the hot wings, they where OK, and the nachos where like High school football game nachos.  Our waitress always acted like she was being bothered.  All in All, I tried this place for food and I will not be going back or recommend to anyone I know.  Drinks only OK!!!  2 words describes this place:  Tourist Trap."
1,"I have to say it's a relief to not have to head south for some good espresso but this may be too far north...not sure. Their espresso is locally roasted and smooth so they automatically go into my top five. I also like the fact that the crowd is decidedly not the coffee snob crowd you'll find in venues further south. That being said, on my first visit the crowd was more the Sunnyslope crowd so I didn't know what to make of everything.\n\nAll that said, the coffee is good and I really liked the choices on their menu and they are all about local business. If I can come here and get a good Americano without having to wait in a long line I think I'm sold!"
-1,"Is there a way to give zero stars?? \nI was waiting in a long line for a taxi home from Phx Sky Harbor. When I finally was given a cab I asked if they took credit. The cab driver said if he had to he could but asked if I would be willing to go to an ATM for cash. I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.\n\nOkay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. \n\nI sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. \n\nWhen I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.\n\nAbout an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the \""story\"". That if I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy that I would have to contact the police. \n\nAbsolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable. I cannot believe any business can successfully run like this. I will go out of my way to never use them again."
-1,"The owner, Nicholas G Nicholas needs to attend a few driving classes before he kills someone. Maybe too much hp for him. If you see an 08 white porsche with FL plate 917 MNC stay clear. Guy drives like a nut. Almost ran me off the road in Boca Raton by 95."
1,Ive been going here over the years. \n\nThe food is always spot on. I can't think of a visit where I left dissatisfied. \n\nI love that I can order Italian or Asian or a little bit of both. \n\nLast night I ordered the Orange Zest chicken and hubs got the seafood Au gratin. Both were fresh and very tasty. We also had the spicy shrimp lettuce wraps to start.They are spicy but have a great flavor. \n\nI must echo the other reviewers about the service. GOOD LORD. Seriously slowest.service.ever. Last night we waited a good 15 minutes for our server to come back with the bill and the hubs credit card. Not cool. We've decided that when we go next time to ask for our bill the second our food comes out.
1,"First of all I'm a regular here, coming in at least once a week for lunch. In other words, I LOVE this place!  Great food, wide variety, weekly specials, and a frequent diner card. \n\nThe servers are super friendly and know their shi....stuff :) Virginia and Amy are awesome. \n\nTomato soup - hands down the BEST I have ever had. Slightly sweet and very creamy. WOW. Serious mouthgasm. \n\nSmothered chicken - excellent gravy. I have had this one more times than I can count. Corn can be a little dry but you can always substitute a different side. \n\nFried pickles - these are spears, not slices, but the breading has great flavor and is very crisp. \n\nQuesadillas and burgers are good, fairly standard but still tasty. \n\nAll of their pastas are excellent. Can't go wrong here. \n\n\nWas not a fan of the meatloaf sandwich but the actual meatloaf dinner is well done. This sandwich is the only thing I ever ordered here that left me at all disappointed and I've probably stuffed my face with 3/4 of the stuff on the menu by now. \n\nOverall, their food has a home cooked, fresh flavor. Nothing tastes likes a tv dinner and for a sports bar, it goes above and beyond what I would expect for food. \n\nLove you Dillo, see you soon!"
1,This is a great shop to find the sexi Billet items for your ride. Purchased an Polished serpentine set up for my SBC and some other dress up items and billet interior parts. Great selection and knowledgable staff. A little over priced for certain things so do your do-diligence and compare prices.
1,"I don't give five stars often, but here's my rationale. Their margaritas rock! It's the only place that you get your money's worth when you order a margarita. They are huge! They have a good variety of cool flavors to try too. Love it. But that's not it. They have the best green chili around, and it is HOT! I love hot spicy food, and this does not disappoint. Lastly, the chips and salsa service is good. I love the bean dip and the two types of salsa provided. i could just sit there and eat that alone. \n\nService is usually good. I normally just cruise in and sit at the bar. Can't wrong with service with the bartender standing in front of you the whole time. :)"
-1,"This is one cheap owner. Now he has downsized the soda, and raised the prices. He will eventually save himself out if a business. Poor value, ok quality."
-1,"Not a terrible experience but not an amazing one. I like LAX as my favorite airport. The wifi is speedy and sso are the check ins. San Deigo has a good airport. I didn't check in so I have never waited in line at TSA. I have had this as a stop over ALOT because I've flown US airways a million times. \n\nIts wifi its spotty. It restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in Carolina. Also no place to plug in devices like Phoenix, Salt Lake, and LA. And the seats are CERTAINLY not designed for sleeping. \n\nEhh.. okay I guess i can't rank the full experience but I assume it never get really busy. for check in and security."
1,"Regardless of what the other reviews state, they carry a lot of different product across all price ranges. They seem to be pushing the low-end \""Bilt\"" line as the majority of the store is stocked with this stuff, but if you look you'll find some decent brands here. The staff is very knowledgable and all seem to be riders who like to talk shop. It's good to have a shop like this locally, keep up the good work guys."
-1,Get your wallet out! This place nickel and dimes you to death and they seem proud of it. \n\nI buy a room for a night and a conference room for a day. In the lobby and my sleeping room I get free internet but when I walk in the conference room they want to rob me of $50.00. The workers were embarrased to tell me this and when I asked to speak to someone in charge they told me the managers will not discuss it. \n\nIf that is not enough they jab me for another $2.65 for a cup of coffee to include a refill. \n\nI don't care how nice the place is (and it is nice) I will not come back.
-1,"I have been a regular at China Chili for over 10 years. Sadly once they moved to the new location on 3rd Street and Flower their quality has been deteriorating.  \n\nWent recently for lunch and ordered the Mongolian Beef and Beef Foo Young and both were awful, no taste, no flavor and very sub standard.  The prices have gone up the quality is shameful.\n\nI think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it.  Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again.\n\nNot sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken. With so many other choices of Asian Food.. this local favorite has not kept up its quality."
1,"There's an Autograph wall in the bar at this particular Hard Rock Cafe. For some reason, the only band I remember seeing was Sugar Ray. Wow. Go Phoenix! Way to bring in the big boys!\n\nReally though, it's a typical Hard Rock. The beer selection was fine, the tables were sturdy, and all the Rock n Roll memorabilia hanging from the walls were able to bring in the post-game crowd. It also shielded us from the crazy summer storm that was building up outside. Hallelujah."
-1,"Clean and in a great location, the Microtel is at the end of the Billy Graham Parkway where it meets Interstate 85. Plenty of parking and close to a Waffle House, a Japanese buffet and the Cracker Barrel.\n\nRooms are small, as you would expect for a place going by the name Microtel. The bed was comfortable and the room was mostly quiet. One night, there was vacuuming upstairs at 1AM. We called the front desk to complain and the noise stopped.\n\nTip: Avoid the ground floor if you are concerned about security. As with anything near a highway (quick getaway), be aware of your surroundings.\n\nThey do have a shuttle minivan to the airport that isn't far away.\n\nWould I stay here again? I don't see why not but there are better."
-1,ooooohhhh\nhaaahaaa wow\nno\nnope \nnever again
-1,"My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \n\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \n\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \n\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers."
1,"Calzones!! This has got to be THE best place for a calzone, hands down. Packed full of cheese, wrapped in a tasty crust,  and then, for a few bucks more, add all your favorite meats and tasty morsals...you'll be walking away feeling like you really ate something special."
1,"For a good hang over destination, Rosita's is the place for me. Bean and cheese burrito with green chili is the perfect stomach soother. \n\nChips are a little to greasy for me, but the salsa has the perfect temp. I like it a little hotter ie (los dos molinos). The only other item I have had at Rosita's is the chimi. Also good, but if you are a bean and cheese fan, the beans are some of the best in town. That probably also means they are some of the more unhealthy beans in town."
-1,"Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar."
1,"After recently returning from Oahu and Maui where I indulged on local cuisine I was craving some good (and cheap) Hawaiian BBQ.  Mokis was the perfect place to put all my cravings to rest.  \n\nPrior to visiting Hawaii in March I never knew exactly what \""Island\"" or \""Hawaiian\"" BBQ was, but now every time I come across any place with a hibiscus flower in the logo I gotta stop and try it out!  Who knew all the way in Arizona, people were doing Hawaiian food, good?!  \n\nMokis has everything that I ate in Hawaii over 7 days all in one spot, from garlic shrimp, to kalua pork to loco moco, even poke and shave iced!  It was hard to choose just one thing so now I have several reasons to return!  I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken with rice and traditional mac salad, everything was delicious and just what I was craving!"
1,"I come here whenever I'm baking something special.  They usually have whatever it is I'm looking for.  If not, it usually can't be found anywhere else either.  I also took one of the classes, GREAT instructors, totally worth the money I spent on supplies.  The staff is always friendly.  The rows are kind of small so if the place is packed it can get awkward, but they're jam packed with stuff so it can't be helped.  Do be careful in the entrance/parking area, it can get a little congested and not everyone pays attention.  Wish there was one closer to me. :)"
1,"If you are a baseball fan and you are visiting Pheonix, this is a must.  Enjoy good food and watch baseball.  Great atmosphere, and most importantly good service."
-1,"Although this store has great employees, it is in desperate need of a makeover.  It is absolutely ghetto inside.  I don't think they've redone the store since the early 90s.  It's an embarrassment on Walnut."
-1,"I think I might have been the first person to go to Phil's for a bite to eat.  Ever.  Definitely more a bar - though the business name here is \""tavern\"", they have a sign that says \""deli\"".  I'm not sure I'd call them a deli.  Not by a long shot.  They have food, and they even have subs, but a deli?  I don't think so.  You go to a deli, and you expect a fat greasy guy named Tony to slice some meat and slap it on a roll.  Not some coed to take all your money.\n\nNonetheless, we were there hanging out - with the kids, actually - after I gave blood prior to the Zombie Walk.  Decided to get a bite since we picked up a discount due to the blood drive.  There is a tiny little area for dining if you don't want the total bar vibe.  And when I say tiny, I mean tiny.  I think it was one table.\n\nThe rest of the place is really a bar.  Or tavern if you want to feel more upscale.\n\nService wasn't too hot.  Or maybe it was hot if you're into that scene.  But it wasn't very good.  They were nice enough and all, but they were definitely not into serving a family of four food - they were wanting to get back to the bar (tavern, sorry) side and generate some better tips.\n\nDespite a proclamation on the menu that they had been rated \""uptown's best burgers\"", I wasn't all that impressed.  Maybe I'm burgered out.  It wasn't bad, but like many places they let it cook too long.  Some of the rest of the family enjoyed it, but ultimately we decided that they liked the grease, not the juice (and there is a difference!).  The meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers.  It's more of a challenge to make it tasty and juicy.\n\nSweet Tea Report: Blech.  Possibly the worst in town.  I have had unsweetened tea at places that was sweeter than this stuff.  I will drink most anything in front of me and I didn't even finish half a glass.  Bottom of the barrel."
1,"Place is the best pizza in arizona, there so nice there too. If ur getting dominos ur an idiot, use the coupon and get a real pizza"
1,This is a really great salon for the price range.  All the girls were welcoming & fun.  The place was clean & I just walked right in.  Cindy did a great gel mani.  Exactly what I wanted & it's been hard to find a place in Phoenix!
1,The Boys at Desert Rat are awesome.  I hate car stuff and am always afraid of being taken because I am  a women.   When I went is they asked what the problem was and took care of me without  trying to tell me I needed more than just the shocks.  I felt comfortable with them.  I will send everyone I know.  Thanks guys!!!
1,"I really enjoy shopping here. The place is always clean, great selection of produce, and friendly service!"
1,"Best HD dealership around - great staff - if you want a bike, ask for Jerry or David. Tell them I sent you. If you want motor clothes, the selection is great and, in typical HD fashion, the girls are terrific. See Tasha or CJ for personal service. In parts, talk to Carlos & the guys. \n\nThis store makes you part of the family without the whiny little sister. No complaints."
-1,"Extremely poor customer service and do not offer the latest innovations in wigs. Maybe they were once the only game in town and are resting on their laurels...if you have breast cancer, the last thing you need is poor service and pushy sales clerks. I would give no stars if that were an option. Stay away."
-1,"(6/24/2013) Well its time for my 3 year check up to see what the state of my pituitary tumor is. For some unfathomable reason CMC-Pineville wanted me to show up an hour early at the main entrance. There is actually plenty of surface parking this early in the morning so that's a plus. The main waiting area is also empty.\n\nThe MRI waiting room features the wide chairs. Some of the chairs have circular tables offset on their left arms.  The room is painted in muted blue and olive green. There is a 47\"" LG tv hung in the middle of the wall containing the check in window. There is also an alcove with a coffee maker & bottled water.\n\nI had been sitting behind a column & for some odd reason the tech didn't look into the entire room. I had to move nearer to the door and wait for her to come out again. The MRI is a GE model installed in 2006. Most MRI machines have their own noises that can actually be melodic. This machine actually made my body vibrate. It was strange.\n\nSo far it was a five star experience but it was soon time to inject me with the radioactive contrast material. Things started going downhill after the MRI tech & another tech attempted to inject me with the material & instead collapsed my veins in both my arms. They next wanted to try my hands and I refused. I told them to butterfly it into a vein on a forearm. Their response was to stick the needle into my left wrist. The contrast was then pushed into the vein burning its way along. I will never have another MRI done there. Perhaps they knew that they wouldn't be getting excellent reviews of their service as I have not received any surveys to complete."
-1,"The food was great, although my only complaint against this location is our server named Courtney was extremely rude and only showed any friendliness towards my friend and I because the manager was in the building. First time at a California Pizza Kitchen but the worst service I've had in my life from a waiter/waitress."
1,"I am in love with the Phoenix Symphony!  I have seen two concerts performed by the Phoenix Symphony so far and I cannot wait to see more.  \n\nMost recently, my husband and I watched the Nutcracker.  We purchased the \""cheap seats,\"" which were still pricey.  We arrived 15 minutes late (tacky, I know).  This stunt ended up being a blessing in disguise.  Since we were late the usher told us we had to sit in the balcony until intermission so that we would not disrupt the show by entering through the main doors.\n\nThere were only a handful of people in the balcony so we pretty much got our pick of seats.  The orchestra was down in the pit (correct term?  Dunno.) and we could actually see the full orchestra from that angle.  It was like panorama view!\n\nAt intermission we went to find our actual seats, but we were turned off by how crowded it was.  Plus, our seats were in the second to last row which wasn't exactly a primo spot.  Mind you, Symphony Hall is not that big so there really isn't a bad seat.  We decided that the balcony was better for us so we made our way back upstairs.\n\nThe previous concert we experienced was with Broadway singer, Cheyenne Jackson. These seats were complimentary from the Phoenix Symphony via our apartment \nmanagement.  On this occasion the orchestra was directly on stage backing up the singer.  This was a more intimate set up, whereas The Nutcracker was more grand. \n\nThe Phoenix Symphony is a great way to sneak in a little culture and to experience one of the treasures of downtown Phoenix."
1,"Roy's is a chain that I've been going to for years.   We like to try different places but sometimes you want that place where you know what to expect and still want quality.   It's really my go to place for any occasion.  \n\nThe fish is always the star for me however I've had a lot of different things on the menu including the filet mignon and the seafood dishes.  The menu changes often, but they always have Ahi tuna and the chocolate souffle is a staple at Roy's.  On Valentines or New Years they usually do a prix fixe. \n\nThe service is good and the ambiance is just right.  Not too casual but not too dressy.  I can wear jeans, the Mrs can dress up and we are blending.  \n\nI don't really care it's a chain either.  Some of my favorite places are technically chains.  Is Roy's perfect on every visit?  No but you can tell that they try to be top notch.   They do enough and the food is good enough to keep me coming back over and over.  Isn't that really the sign of a good restaurant?"
1,"This was a cool place, sure it's a tourist trap! What do you expect people!! When you walking down main street, the buildings make you wonder about the old wild west days. It's really neat. The first building you walk into is their candy and fudge store! Boy, I spent most of my money their. Fudge was awesome, and you will find some candy that will bring back memories! (If you still have any) This place have a variety of places to visit, they also have three tours, we only went on the train. The train was nice, it's only goes around the town and tells you stories of the past. Hey Taryn C., pull your head out of you liberal ass and smell the roses! No one cares what hell your saying! (trying to keep this clean) Sounded like someone pissed in your cheerios that day? There are tourist traps all over New York, so lay off! When it's all said and done, I had a good time. And will bring my family over to visit."
1,"My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago.  We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was \""Kids Eat Free\"" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....\n\nThe pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  \n\nSo for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  \nOh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!\n\nTry the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!\n\nThis is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!"
-1,"Very sad to find that donuts are made the day before.  I ordered three dozen donuts at about $10 a dozen, and found them to be stale and bordering on disgusting.  With all the awesome donuts in this town, why would you sell \""yesterday's donuts at today's prices?\""  Won't be returning there for any baked products as I have no idea when they may have been baked.  The woman that works at the counter is very sweet, I wanted to support this local business, sadly, I cannot."
1,"It was my first time out to Phoenix, and I only had a few hours to spare before heading out to the wedding I was going to, so I decided to go out to the Desert Botanical Garden.\n\nAs you entered they had a few of the Chuhily glass pieces, which are beautiful and are lit once evening starts to fall. I was also pleased that they offered a student discount with a valid ID. The staff were also very friendly and willing to help and direct you. The plant life was brilliant;  I'm still amazed at the size of the saguaro cacti. Additionally I saw some roadrunners, quail, and other birds.\n\nWhen I went they also had the Monarch Butterfly exhibit, which I visited. There were plently of butterflies to see and take pictures of. Overall, I thought it was worth the money and few hours I spent there."
1,"This is a delicious spot especially for lunch. Sushi is fresh and good. Spicy gyoza soup appetizer is delicious and flavorful. The shrimp lettuce wraps aren't traditional, they taste more like something you would serve on top of rice, however they are amazing!! Tan tan men is good for a cold day, but doesn't have much meat.. Huge portion of noodles though. Place is so cute inside even though it looks like a shitty strip mall location! Must go! I will be back many more times."
1,My favorite Pho but I think it has a new name now?
1,"Out to eat with friends from work.  Really good food!  I had the Combo plate:  2 little tamales, 4 mini-chimi's (2 chicken/2beef), 2 taquitos, and spinach queso dip.  Brought some home!  Service was good."
-1,"Such a shame because this place has so much potential for being a cool little local business. But the owners/managers are the rudest, most disdainful people who seemed almost gleeful for me to leave without purchasing something. I went in to purchase either some classy paper or a unique card to write a note to a homeowner to whom I was considering placing a purchase offer for their house. It's a stationary store, so I didn't think my request was unusual. The products there were outdated, in many cases even dusty, overpriced (which honestly, I would have paid a local business if the product had been unique and quality), and disorganized. I was asked if I needed help, to which I replied yes and explained my situation, and a very curt man stood in a back corner and pointed to various corners of the store and said, \""Look there and there and there and there,\"" AND THEN HE WALKED OUT OF THE STORE.\n\nI'll seriously never step foot in Weldin's again, and felt it necessary to post publicly about the experience. Such a shame.\n\nBTW, I found a delightful card next door at CVS. It was made of wood. Very unique. Go figure. ;)"
-1,If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all. I got a fill and a fix because I broke a nail. First off they didn't cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long. Second off they are so thin I feel like they are just going to crack off.  Not to mention it seems very dirty.. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. One of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me. I will not be returning again.
-1,"I really don't get Giant Eagle. They are nice enough, but pricing just makes no sense at all to me. It is close to my house so I'll drop in to buy a thing or two, but would rather go just about anywhere else for my weekly shopping trip."
1,"I love Mama's!!!!!\n\nMy family and I walk over to Mama's all the time... the coffee is great, the staff is cool, & the owner always comes out and gives our puppy treats. This is a cool little coffee house... a refreshing break from the corporate \""coffee\"" joints.\n\nThanks Mama's!!!"
-1,"I Hesitated to write this review on the Phoenix VA Hospital, but it should be said.  Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older. Diabetes was not magically going away, it needed treatment.    They seemed to have no interest in seeing me.  I could not depend on that, so I have had to make other plans in life. I would not be able to retire in Arizona.    I think that is a shame in itself.  I realize everyone has a different experience, but I gave mine and it is a honest review of what happened to me in 2013.   I was so sorry to hear of the veterans that had died over these delays in care.  It is a disgrace but I am not surprised at all by this behavior in Phoenix.  They obviously are overwhelmed.  They need a 2nd hospital for one thing and a lot more staff."
-1,From living in NYC for 27 years I tried this place and I took one bite and threw it all away. And very expensive
-1,"this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.\n\nIf you find yourself at Rolands, do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the Strip District.  Seriously."
1,They met my tight time line for two dresses i needed on the weekend. even called and gave me the time i could pick them up. very efficient and friendly bunch.
1,"I love Faye for facials! She is awesome! She is professional, knowledgable, and well worded. Her facial massage is just wonderful. She takes care of any issues with my skin and suggests product that is appropriate but is not pushy. I would suggest her to anyone , any day of the week!"
-1,"Yeah, I have to agree with the other reviews. Had the fish fry last week. Really tasteless and not good. Some pieces were way over cooked. Salad bar was ok, but all the prices are high for what you get. Bar area was nice and bartenders nice and quick to get drinks. I think this place must be better for steaks or breakfast - skip the fish."
-1,I'm a lawyer in NY and I'm visiting a friend in Pittsburgh. I am blown away by the code violations in this unit. The tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail. I am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in PA.
-1,"Not really a fan.  If you go for the coffee drinks or even better chai, you'll be ok.  Sammiches are cheap but tiny and, honestly, nothing special.\n\nI did not think much of the decor/atmo/etc; many seemed to like, but was underwhelming to yours truly..."
-1,"I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for $6, I got 4 slices of skinny green tomatoes, deep fried and over battered.  Tried their fried chicken, it wsa crispy but why is the portion so small. The table cloth is grimy and sticky..\n\nTry a Waffle house and I think you'll have a better dining experience."
-1,"If you want \""Italian food\"" that has the look and feel of a Stouffer's t.v. dinner, Fazoli's gets it right.\n\nActually, I take that back.  If you are heating up a t.v. dinner, at least you are guaranteed it will be warm."
-1,"I really dislike Menard's.  For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish."
-1,"Has the potential for a sweet, intimate venue.  However, when I went the crowd was very disrespectful, so much so that the artist requested that people stop talking.  I couldn't hear the music due to all the people noise, so I will not go here again for someone I'm really into."
1,"This place was amazing.  I went there for lunch today and I can't wait to go back.  I was greeted at the door by Angelo, the owner.  I felt very special and welcomed.  The atmosphere was very intimate.  Kind of reminds you of an East Coast old school Italian restaurant.  \n\nThe trio of pasta was excellent.  My favorite was the gnocchi in Alfredo sauce.  All 3 were fabulous, but the gnocchi was exceptional. \n\nI've already made plans to go back for dinner with my husband.  \n\nI went on Groupon, just to try it out, but I would have gladly paid full price."
1,"I want to talk about the Pizza at Niccoli's! A few decades ago my best friend and I discovered this place. Note: we both come from Italian family's who were raised on good ingredients that only a deli can have. This is not your hut kind of pizza. Then we went back and poof it was gone! Skip forward a couple of decades, and we were still talking about this pizza and how good it really is, when our friend said, \""Oh yeah, I know where they are now.\"" We got over there had the pizza and BAM there was the best Pizza we ever had in Phoenix! If you are looking for an authentic NYC pizza made with ingredients only Italians use, Niccoli's is the place."
-1,"Let's talk about the weird interaction I had with a Barista here.  I asked if they offered free internet.  Simple question, right?  She hesitated and then went on this whole diatribe about how it used to be free, and then it wasn't and now it kinda is, but she wasn't sure.  I swear that's exactly what she said.  So she hesitantly gives me this paper, pulled off from a whole stack mind you, of the Internet name and password.  At this point I'm confused...do you not want me to be here?  Is it free?  I finally got my answer when I logged on with no issues, it's free.  Why all the hassle??\n\nThe only reason I can see (and seriously a big one) is the coffee shop hanger on-ers.  I can only imagine how this has become an epidemic in spots like this.  Hip spots with lots of students and recent grads who want to scope out the free internet havens.  I get it....the coffee shop wants you to get your coffee, hang out for approximately 2 hours and leave.  I'm sure this is not the case...and that people hang out enough that they could easily put on an apron and handle orders behind the counter.  So long story short, this place is PACKED.  Packed like you usually have to take a couple laps to find a free table....or even lone chair!  It's a little annoying. Plus, you're most likely going to see what the person next to you/on top of you is doing.  Oh, sweet game of chess there dude....\n\nOh yeah, my chai was okay, Oregon Chai Mix (my third fav after a homemade mix or Intellegentsia).   Made exactly how I ordered it, extra hot, which a lot of people do not do correctly (it needs to burn my tongue, for realz).  \n\nBut for me, this is a spot I'd avoid....way too crowded!"
1,"Phoenix is very fortunate to have such an awesome zoo. It is an awesome zoo that left a strong impression on me when I visited in 2004. Fast forward eight years, and we drove over 200 miles from Las Vegas to Phoenix to see it. The Phoenix Zoo is so awesome that if I had the power, I would trade the best Las Vegas casino for the Phoenix Zoo. Since I don't have that power, I will write a review of why the Phoenix Zoo is so awesome.Instead of repeating facts such as admission is $20, I broke the review into sections. Each section discusses the awesome characteristics of the sections of the zoo.\n\nTropics Trail\n\n  As Phoenix builds a bigger and better Phoenix Zoo, the temporary entrance is near Tropics Trail at the far right . This is where visitors get their first impressions of the Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are the elephant, jaguar, tortoise, iguana, Andean Bear, rhinoceros, anteater, flamingo, and manned wolf. \n\nChildren's Trail\n\n  The southeast section of the Phoenix Zoo is more than a children's zoo. Because it sits on the south side of water it is a hot spot for waterfowl viewing. On the path to the petting zoo is emu, bald eagles, an island showcasing siamang, warty pigs, and ocelot. The highlight of the Children's Trail is the Harmony Farm. Grownup children will also enjoy the Big Red Barn and windmill house.\n\nThe Main Lake\n\n  The Main Lake is the central right area of Phoenix Zoo where the walkways circle Main Lake. Besides the Main Lake; the highlight exhibits include Land of the Dragons, two islands showcasing lemur, otter, flamingos, and gibbon. For an additional expense there is a camel ride. By this time you might be hungry or thirsty. The Cavern Cafe serves decent food and soft drinks.\n\nAfrica Trail\n\n  The Africa Trail sits at the back center of Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are cheetahs, African wild dog, baboons, mandrils, warthogs, lions, and tigers.\n\nArizona Trail\n\n  The Arizona Trail is my favorite area of the Phoenix Zoo. It is here that a visit to the zoo changes into a hike into wild Arizona. The bighorn sheep exhibit is off the charts well done. The bighorn sheep exhibit incorporates a real mountain. This is the exhibit that leaves an imprint that Phoenix Zoo is awesome. It could be the best bighorn sheep exhibit in the country. Throughout Arizona Trail, natural Arizona treats the zoogoer to four star scenery and first rate pictures. It is the part of the zoo where bunny rabbits outpopulate wild animals. The Wild Arizona Trail, in my opinion is worth $10 of the $20 admission.\n\n  The Arizona Trail is discontinuous. To the left of the Zoo Plaza there is a more developed Arizona Trail. Here the highlight exhibits are bobcats, Mexican Wolf, Mountain lion, and pronghorn. This is also where the First Aid Station is located.\n\nThe Savanna\n\n  The Savanna is the center of the Phoenix Zoo. In the future it will be the main entrance. It serves as the plaza and savanna section of the Phoenix Zoo. Here you have Savanna Grill (my brother said there burgers are good) and Karibu Cafe. This is where the gift shop is. The main Safari Train Station is here. The highlight exhibit is a savanna showcasing giraffes, eland, and zebras. There is also a stingray bay.\n\nThe Exit\n\n  I left the Phoenix Zoo impressed. I was disheartened that it closes at 4 p.m. and that Las Vegas does not have a Phoenix Zoo. Headed to my car, it was time to explore more of Phoenix. Phoenix Zoo is near downtown Phoenix and Tempe, and Arizona Mills."
1,"We love to get take out at Los Taquitos on a busy week night when we are too tired to cook. They are super fast and dinner for 4 is usually under $20! \n\nI love the street tacos and my husband the ceviche. Son loves the carne asada burrito, daughter the tamales. Seriously something for everyone. There IS some variability in the spicy factor, but we are total regulars. Gotta try it!"
1,"I got to thinking about Osso Bucco the other day.\n\nMy new Dutch Ovens brought this on, I'm kind of obsessed with braised meat right  now. What to braise, how to braise, which pot to use... must be because of the freezing cold temperatures. \n\nAnyway. \n\nA few years back my dad and the evil stepmonster (she's gone now, as in they got divorced, in their 70's, can I hear an AMEN sister?) could not stop talking about Christos. \n\nThey would talk about it all the time. \n\nIn Oregon.\n\nLike, in the middle of a nice dinner at Jake's. \n\nWeird.\n\nAlso, rude. \n\nI just chalked it up to stepmonster's name dropping mental health condition. \n\nNo seriously, she drops names all the time. ANNOYING. anyway, ahem.\n\nIt was Osso Bucco this, Osso Bucco that, Christos this, Christos that. \n\nSo, when I was down there on a visit, post stepmonster,  I made my Dad take me.\n\nIt's good stuff. \n\nI don't even eat veal. \n\nBut the Osso Bucco rocks. \n\nEverything else did, too. I liked the service, the feel of the place, and I liked the calamari, and the wine. All good. \n\nif you're in Phoenix and you want a good meal, I'd say this is one of the places to go."
1,"As a Phoenician I sometimes forget that we're lucky to have nature trails in the midst of the urban sprawl of this desert city. We may not have a memorable downtown skyline but something Phoenix does have a lot of are mountains that serve as a backdrop of gorgeous scenery. We are blessed to have many mountains with trails in each \""park\"" like North Mountain, the Mcdowell's, the Estrella's, Camelback, and the Grand Dame of Phoenix, South Mountain. This range or urban park which is considered the world's largest serves as a visual landmark to many. During the day, coming from downtown and head down Central Ave, South Mountain towers majestically over this metropolis and at night, the glimmering red lights of the tv/radio towers that sit at its summit just sparkle. It provides direction, and this natural backdrop can also lay claim to being a memorable Phoenix landmark. But apart from its visual beauty this urban park provides an active recreation outlet to residents of metro Phoenix for it has many different trailheads at various points from Ahwatukee to Laveen. I liken South Mountain to be like Runyon Canyon in Hollywood, but here we have far more trails and it ranges from the easy to the difficult. And like Runyon Canyon you can drive up South Mountain and look below and see the grand expanse of sprawl glowing under the night sky and just take it all in. Yes, we are lucky to have this, literally in our backyard."
1,"I'm probably not a dentist or dental hygienists' dream.  I tend to not keep up with regular appointments and I'm ridiculously nervous in any area of the dentist office.  This has been my M.O. my whole life.  But my few experiences at Artistic Dental may have changed that for me.  Here's a few areas worth noting.\n\nThe office.  Artist Dental has a beautiful office located in the Camelback Corridor area.  They provide a very relaxed, homey feel to their waiting area, where you have a choice of chilled bottled waters, keurig coffees and teas and various snacks.  I don't imagine anyone who was about to see the dentist take up any of these offers but it's nice to the have the option while waiting for someone else or as you're headed out of the office.  Additionally, they provide views from each dentist chair (not sure what they are called) so you can see the sky and the beautiful church across the street.  They also have water features and lots of greenery to help soothe the nerves.  :) \n\nStaff.  The staff is really remarkable.  They provide wonderful customer service and professionalism.  They certainly make you feel like they care about you and make you feel comfortable and let's face it, no one feels comfortable at the dentist office.\n\nMary M. (dental hygienist), is one of the most kind, gentle and pleasant people I've been around.   She does an excellent job and shows remarkable patience for squirmy patients like me.  \n\nI've recently had the pleasure of working with Dr. Adhikari.  She has greatly helped with my fear of being in the dentist chair.  She's caring, patient and extremely funny which only makes the process that much easier.   I recently had to have a partial on my back molar and she made the process feel like a cake walk.  She explained all the steps, took a conservative approach and and established a relationship with me which made me feel at ease.   Because of Dr. Adhikari, I'm now brave enough to move forward with a dental issue I've been putting on the back burner for years.  \n\nBritni (Dental Assistant), was also a great pleasure to work with.  She is extremely professional but in a kind and gentle way. \n\nAdditional, the office allows for fraidy cats like me to listen to music while having any work done, rather it's a cleaning or something like a crown and cozy up in their plush blankets to help relax the nerves.  :)\n\nThe office of Artist Dental is a top notch office and I would highly recommend it as your dentist office too."
-1,Always busy!  Selection of veggies are ok.  Selection of fruit is a little below average.  Otherwise it has everything you'd expect from a chain grocery store.\n\nMain complaint with this location is that the organization of aisles and products are not logical.  You often see items in multiple locations because the layout of the store was clearly not thought out.
1,"Items selected included:\nBlueberry Cake\nButtermilk Cake\nStrawberry Raised\nApple Fritter\nChocolate Oreo\nMaple Bacon\n\nFor their last day in Phoenix I took my mother and aunt to La Grande Orange - easily my favorite spot in The Valley - but being late risers I decided to grab some donuts beforehand just down the street at Rainbow Donuts, an independent branch of the local chain that many claim to make the best donuts in the area.  Opening early - I believe 4am - and at least by 5:15am when I arrived on 12/31 the shop is small and anything but trendy, the only other patrons during my visit a trio of old veterans who apparently meet there daily, but with a friendly staff and an interesting selection of classics and novel options alike I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nSelecting a half dozen donuts and taking portions of each home it likely comes as no surprise that the warm cake donuts were my favorite - the buttermilk bar literally still dripping glaze - and with the blueberry subtle and light plus the fritter less greasy than the average with a great crunch giving way to cinnamon apples within I enjoyed all three more than those that were raised - the dough a bit less wispy or raised than I prefer and the frosting on both the maple and the strawberry a bit too artificial, though the Oreo option was admittedly quite good as the frosting approximated the flavor of Nestle Quick."
-1,They deserve negative stars I heard that there is new owners and it shows from a terrific caterer to a terrible one I've used them for many charitable events it was always on point now I wouldn't recommend them to the dog pound
-1,Quite possibly the SLOWEST moving place on earth. Took over 30 mins to get a car. \n\nWait line is slow and long to get keys and then super long wait for car to be pulled up. \n\nDoesn't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient?\n\nAvoid this one if you can.
1,"There is nothing bad I can say about my experience here. The staff was wonderful, the nurses were wonderful, and most importantly Dr. Nelson was the best doctor I could have ever asked for. He always listened to my concerns and is extremely knowledgeable and reassuring. I wouldn't have anyone else deliver my babies."
1,"Generous portions and seriously good food at cheap prices. Although I'm no expert, I hear the food is remarkably authentic, with Japanese, Chinese and Korean influences. I especially like the Hawaiin chicken rice and pork laulau. Oh, and don't forget the mayo-macaroni salad served with every order. All this culture in a strip mall at the crossroads of Tempe, Chandler & Mesa. Aloha!"
1,"This one time, at Apollos, some gay dudes asked my friend and I if we were real women. I knew I should have waxed my mustache before going out that night! \n\nBut never mind that snafu- I always feel like a diva here!\n\nThe girls and I have been to Apollos a handful of times for karaoke and I'm always a drunken mess every time I leave there. Well I certainly can't handle my liquor but the drinks are poured well here. They have cheap cheap drinks and the first  time I was there, I think the Pink Panther martinis did it for me. They were only $4 too!\n\nGreat place to gather a bunch of friends for karaoke. Yes its a gay bar but the coolest one. I've always met great guys there. They are never interested in me but they are always so nice and willing to sing a duet with me. The karaoke host is always fun, not a mic hog like some places. My only complaint is that my gay friends like to sing lots of show tunes. BORING! There are definitely some great performers here and but most are here to have a good time so don't feel like you need to belt like Whitney Houston to come here. \n\nMy favorite things about Apollos are:\n1) free fresh popcorn! best thing to munch on after you've had a lot to drink\n2) the ladies room never has a line because its mainly gay dudes that frequent this place\n\nI love Apollos!"
-1,"I took my sixteen year old  Scottie in because he had stopped eating and drinking and was very, very ill.  I had called the night before to tell them that if he lived through the night, I would be bringing him in.  He was in total distress and clinging to life.  \nI was put in a room, where I was told to wait for an unknown time.  My dog was gasping for air.  I asked that he be viewed as the emergency,  that he was.  I was told again to sit down and wait.  I waited for a few more minutes and then walked out!  I went straight to Orangewood Pet Hospital where I was immediately taken care of and where blood work done. It was obvious that my dog needed to be put to sleep.  The experience was as good as any experience of that nature could be.  I am disgusted with the clinical, uncaring atmosphere of Squaw Peak Animal Hospital."
-1,"We bought our son a 2004 car here about a month ago. So far, we had to have the clutch replaced. Luckily it happened within 3 days of purchasing it so they fixed it for free. BUT, the car has been giving our son trouble when trying to start it. Dropped it at a local shop to see what is wrong. You name it - it needs replaced! Over $2000 to get it fixed. And some of these things are safety items and shouldn't be driven by anybody! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all and I WILL NEVER EVER return! Total rip off kind of people! Not trustworthy! I can't imagine doing this to people every day. What kind of people are they? What a sad day."
-1,"I decided to try this place after reading on Yelp how good it is.  This is no Mike and Tony's or big greek gyro in Market square.  I won't be back.  They only take cash. The workers are not Greek chefs and are very condescending.   The gyro sandwich for $5 was OK at best.  They threw some tomatoes on it. The sauce could be better.  The fries for $2.50 were undercooked.  I asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle.  We are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. It was definitely not Heinz which is a sin in Pittsburgh!   I had to hunt silverware and straws.  You would think they would give them to you with the meal.  \n\nThey charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills.  They put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution.  You can also get a drink from their cooler for $1.  They are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less.  \n\nTables were not very clean.  I was surprised at the number of patrons.  This place is definitely regularly visited. They have daily specials, but the #1 item on my list is quality and taste of food.  They get a C from me."
1,This is our favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is delicious and the price is right. They are fast and always quite friendly.
1,":] best starbucks around & probably one of the best i've ever been too... & i'm not just saying that because i work there, but it really has a great atmosphere, huge lobby to come study or just hangout, & the drinks are always good. :]"
-1,"I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \""I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\"" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \"" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\"" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all."
-1,"Nope. Sorry, I grew up in pgh. Heart of a true pittsburgher. But my gosh. One word for prantl's: crisco. Seriously, my arteries hurt after eating a desert from this place. Not half as good as a few of the French etc bakeries around. Why waste your cardiovascular health on this place--go get gelato next door and you'll be better off!"
-1,"I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for. \n\nFor starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.\n\nThe staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.\n\nImperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons."
-1,I know this is just a grocery store but I have never had such an unpleasant experience at any other grocery store.  The employees were not helpful in locating the items I needed and their selection is limited.  I never get asked if I found everything ok.  Also upon my first visit there when asked if I had their preferred shopper card and I said no because I just moved to the area. At that point I was not offered the option of obtaining a card so that I could enjoy their preferred pricing on items.   If I had the option of a different grocery store closer I would definitely avoid this store.
-1,"I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.\n\nThe entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the \""fancy\"" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.\n\nThis place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on."
1,"This is my pediatrician and I absolutely love them! I switched from N. Scottsdale Pediatrics because I never saw the same Dr. twice there. It felt more like a clinic and I wanted to establish a trusting relationship with my Pediatrician who would be there consistently for my children.\n\nI couldn't be happier. It's not as fancy with flat screen tv's and decor as the N. Scottsdale office, but the care my family has received has been stellar. Pretty much everyone I know goes to them know and I haven't heard anything but positive stories.\n\nDuring flu season, they're open on the weekends! Who does that? I feel 100% confident about recommending them."
-1,"We went here on a Friday night so it was extremely busy, which is to be expected.  \n\nHowever management obviously didn't plan staffing well because the waitresses were in a frenzy trying to keep up.  Our particular waitress was clearly unnerved and looked miserable.  It wasn't hard to see that she didn't want to make small talk, she just wanted you to hurry up and order.  So we did.  It took a really long time for the food to come up.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our main entrees.  The food was just ok, and our waitress messed up my dining companion's order and when we asked about it she was like, \""oh sorry!\"" as she dashed away and that was the end of that.  \n\nSo the food was average, not great.\nThe service was rushed and unfriendly.\nNot worth the price."
1,Love this place great staff good prices  the staff is there to answer questions love my local businesses
-1,"I got there at midnight to pick up my rental and the entrance was gated... After checking to make sure we weren't missing another possible entrance, we drove up to the exit and the pleasant employee informed me that they close the gate at midnight and everyone has to come in through this way... You know what would have been nice?  A sign that says that on the closed gate!  Something with a nice, little arrow that says, \""Hey, we're still open, just go right down here.\""  Is that hard?  I guess so.\n\nInside, the woman working at the counter was nice... She had me completely finished in about 10 minutes and I headed out to the car... It was a 2013 White Dodge Dart... I took a nice lap around the outside to make sure there weren't any dings or anything and went off into the night... I heard a weird ping sound while I was driving a few minutes in, but it was directly behind me, so I figured I would just check it out when I got home since we live pretty close to the airport... Ladies and gentlemen, I got home and checked the backseat of my rental car to find an empty bottle of Great Lakes' delicious Commodore Perry IPA!  Look, I understand that it's a delicious beer... I love beer almost any time, but you know when I don't love it?  When it's in my rental car, rolling around in the backseat with a fricking open container charge attached to it! What the H?! Upon contacting them the next day (because the manager wasn't onsite), I found out that the manager would \""talk to the employee\"" that cleans the cars, but they would accommodate me when I returned... \n\nThe car worked fine for the trip and it was time to return it... We pulled into the bay... We cleaned the interior and unpacked the luggage, but still hadn't seen a person to check us in... After about 10 minutes, I spotted two employees standing by a door, doing nothing... As I walked by them, they walked into the bay of cars, but only pressed on the hoods of them for some reason and just leisurely walked on to the next... Once I got to the front of the bay, I noticed a small sign that didn't even reach past the height of the hood of the car it was in front of ... It said that they do not have people to check in their cars... You have to leave the keys in the ignition, write down the mileage and check in the car inside... So no inspection upon return, guys?  I'm just supposed to trust that you won't run up some random charge on my card for damage or what not?  Really? \n\nInside was a straight up flustercluck... There is no other way to describe it... About 15 people waiting in line for TWO attendants and one of them ended up being tied up by one lady from France who didn't know she needed a $200 hold on her card... Apparently her boyfriend rented the car for her, but she doesn't have any more money and he won't go to the bank to put more money in the account... But she doesn't understand because this is a once in a lifetime thing and he never does anything for her and she needs him to leave where he is and go to the bank...  But he doesn't... At least not for the half hour I was in line to return this stupid car... The employee listened to her calmly and explained her options, so he gets points for that, at least... Then I noticed two other people come out of the back, walk through the area we were in and head outside... One of them was very clearly identified as a manager... How in the H do you miss a loudly complaining customer and about 15 other people with extremely unhappy looks on their faces packed into your lobby if you're in charge of something?  Oh, I know... You just don't give a f***... That's how.\n\nUgh.  Look, if you want to be open 24 hours, then you need to have enough employees on staff to make that happen as smoothly as possible... Otherwise, just close down and leave that for people that understand that good customer service doesn't only happen during traditional business hours! Oh! And my accommodation made for my possible arrest?  A 10% off coupon for another rental... Let me tell you where you can put that... On my next trip out of town, I will be renting a horse and leaving days ahead of schedule..."
1,"A very reliable local garage. Bill is all about great customer service, and goes the extra mile. He deflated my fears about \""being taken\"" by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance. He's a truly good guy, knows his stuff, and will work to save me money if he can find it. I trust Bill, and 25th Street Automotive. Thanks, and we'll continue to bring our wheels into your shop."
1,"Looking for a good lunch, try this place.\nExcellent service, good menu selection, very reasonable prices.\nLiked the flat bread pizza, just right.\nWait staff checked our table regularly. \nWill go here first on next visit to Casa Grande."
1,Ladies and gentlemen let's get our feed bags on the portions are huge here. When you enter the restaurant there is a lot to take in lots of things all over to look at but pretty cool. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak two fork tender pieces of beef lightly battered fried and topped with  homemade gravy. All entrees served with salad or Cole Slaw homemade mashed potatoes and gravy or texaz fries bread and butter. I would say this meal could feed someone for a week it's a lot of food but really good so if you want a great Chicken Fried Steak it's a must try.
1,"After a 9 year absence from the Valley, I needed to find a stylist. I have fine, thin, 85% grey hair that I wear blond and highlighted.  Eva is a caring stylist and very good with color. After 6 months she changed the color to make a darker low light and gave me blond highlights which look quite good. Her haircuts are spot on. She takes the time to listen to your concerns and is eager to please.  I agree that assistants sometimes do the blow dry and/or shampoo. I'd rather have Eva do everything, but understand the cooperative nature of the salon. I think blowdrying should be included in the price of your cut and color, but it is extra, making it an expensive but necessary procedure. I would recommend the salon and especially Eva."
1,"I hadn't been here since the yelp event last year. The chips and salsa are to die for and it it took everything in me not to eat all of the, since I call myself being \""good\"". I did order the shrimp tacos (sans the tortilla) which were delicious and the service was great. I will definitely come back again to see how things are during happy hour and heck just for the chips and salsa."
-1,"Lake is very nice. But, I just noticed servers have tables inside and out. That makes them late to the tables they need to take care of and the decor was poor. I got a chipotle chicken sandwich and the bun was really soggy from the pickle juice, but the chicken was really tasty, and juicy. \n\nIn conclusion, it needs some work (decor, waiters and waitresses dealing with tables in and out."
1,"Not only were they friendly, but they made it possible for me to be able to get my vehicle back during a typical stressful work day! They went above and beyond! I will use them for any tire issues! I have typically gone to the one on Bell, which are wonderful as well, but this location was closure to my job and provided the same great service I was used to!"
-1,"This place is over-rated.  It's a place that opened up after my time, but I had heard great things about it and I tried it the last time I was there.  It was just like the \""2 star\"" thing says... \""meh\"".\n\nI'm sure it does well with the student population down in school, cuz it's pretty fast and cheap.  But if you want real pita sandwiches, falafel and what not, come up to the Chicago-area and you'll love some of the stuff up here."
1,"We don't come here often, but when we want to splurge on fries with feta cheese, ranch and buffalo sauce... this is the place to go!\nAnd we were in the mood for exactly that today.\n\nHubby had the regular gyro, I had the chipotle gyro. They both were good. Service was fast.\n\nNote:\n** We asked for extra tzatziki and we were charged 49 cents for it. It was a little too much dill for my taste but it was OK.\n** We were coming from the movies, so we had had our huge drinks... I had an Entertainment Book coupon but it was pretty much useless, because it is for only 50% off a second entree, and you have to order 2 drinks... so it not much of a deal, you probably are better off skipping the coupon and the sodas (healthier and cheaper)\n** However... we asked for water and... it tastes terrible. I think it has happened before. For the last year or so I am trying to drink more plain water and less sugary drinks/artificial sweeteners, so this is not the place for that : (\n\nWe also thought the gyros seemed smaller this time.\n\nLast time I think I ordered a gyro salad and it was good and huge. I also remember baba ganoush has been very good here."
1,"I see there are still several 1-Star reviews in place for Pancho's here.  What a shame to waste them on this fun place when there are a few ACTUAL 1-Star restaurants in the Valley!  \n\nI enjoy Pancho's every time I come here, probably about once a month on average... & people, please cut the crap about it not being \""genuine\"" Mexican food.  Have some of their Chile Verde Stew & tell me that it's not authentic... & tell me you've ever had it better anywhere else.  While you're about it, notice that they have FIVE soups & stews, all delicious.  Where else have you seen five soups, except at Sweet Tomatoes & Souper Salad where soup is the main course?!\n\nYesterday, along with the delicious Chile Verde Stew, I had a bowl of their Cheesy Chicken Tortilla Soup, an enchilada with tasty white sauce (!), some excellent homemade style potato salad, a turkey taquito (!), of course with all the delicious Guacamol\u00e9 you want, & so on.\n\nYou 1-Star snobs go ahead & go to Barrio Caf\u00e9 & pay $10.50 for some Guacamol\u00e9 with nothing to put it on!  ...or $21 for a lonely Chil\u00e9 Relleno all by itself!  I'll be right here at Pancho's thank you."
-1,"The food here is always pretty good, especially if you go to the restaurant to get it.  I've only ordered delivery from here a couple of times, and it's been a nightmare on both occasions.  Thinking the first time was a fluke, I tried again about a year later.\n\nI called them after waiting about 90 minutes, sure that they had forgotten about me.  I was reassured that my order was being made, but not to expect it until another hour or so, because they only have one delivery driver. When the food did get to my home, I could tell it would have been good if it had been hot and correct.  It was neither.\n\nThey're operating the whole restaurant with one counter person, one delivery driver, and one cook.  I understand the desire for low overhead, but I really am not so sure anymore that the food is \""worth the wait.\"""
1,Great little theatre- very intimate- Bar gets a bit crowded but overall nice experience. \nSaw the Spouse Whisperer- Mark Cordes is hilarious.  Don't remember the last time I laughed so hard....
-1,"Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon, that we had purchased specifically for Fujo. They refused to take it, and the manager told us, \""you have two choices, ask for a refund from groupon or just eat here without it.\"" If we had been rude then I wouldn't be able to blame him, but we had politely and calmly spoke to them and asked about it. We walked out and went to Emzy for sushi instead and it had great service and excellent food."
-1,We had special ordered doors which were delivered late. We received no notice that there would be a delay and calls to the millwork department went unanswered or a long time was spent on hold waiting for someone to be tracked down. In-person visits were very stressful because there was never enough staff in the department and oftentimes there was no one around at all. Overall we've not had problems with the store but after the experience we had with the millwork department it is doubtful we will ever return.
-1,"Well, I read the reviews and thought this would be impressive. Nothing could be farther from the truth! The dude at the counter appeared annoyed that we interrupted him yesterday, the portions on the beans and potato salad were miniscule (I was unaware that you could even serve beans and potato salad in a cup designed for condiments, but lo and behold, here it was--- 3 bites later and both were history). We had the pulled pork sandwiches, and I make better at home. The bbq sauce was good, but that was about it. We don't plan on coming back ever, especially not for $23.00 for 2 people... But, we did fill up on gelato at the mall about 20 minutes later as we were still hungry when we left. I'm wondering where in the heck the other folks on here ate, because this wasn't at all the same experience they had."
-1,"\""WOW, this place is EXPENSIVE!\"" ... is what I would say if Dean & Deluca cut all their prices in half.\n\nI'm giving them 1 star because I feel that they make no effort at all to cater to anyone other than the uber-rich.   Like everything else in Phillips Place, D&D is just another spot where the wealthiest people in Charlotte can spend obscene sums of money on stuff they really don't need, while the rest of the country struggles to find employment and to stop their houses from being foreclosed upon.\n\nDon't get me wrong, D&D has high-quality, delicious foods.  If I had a few million dollars in the bank, and didn't mind getting ripped off, I'd probably do all my shopping here."
-1,"just ew.\n\ndirty bathrooms.\nplastic-y vegetables.\nwatery gravy.\nbland mashed potatoes.\niceberg lettuce and pink tomato \""salad.\""\n\nthis is the taco bell of diners...the food is cheap for a reason. do yourself a favor and skip it. when denny's food looks fresh in comparison, you know you're in the wrong place.\n\n*sigh*\n\nlola"
1,"lol, the stories of the owner cutting off college kids who try to practice their Japanese on him makes me like the guy even more.  The food is pretty good, too.  This place gets HOT in the summertime, I think it is a combination of the big windows on an older building, and AC turned too low."
1,"The most Amazing Croissants I've had outside of Paris. My husband and enjoyed omlettes with croissants.  We shared a Chocolate Croissant with coffee and savored every bite. I bought 2 more Chocolate Croissants to bring home for my daughters. Authentic French pastries and the staff is very kind. The best part, no wait or noisy crowds on a Saturday morning. This place is definitely a treasure worth every penny. We'll be back for more yummy French cuisine. Come and taste for yourself!"
1,"I am a fan. But I would like to be more of a fan, and so I am here harping on the two problems I have with CC. One is the parking mentioned by other reviewers and the other is the bad service at the food court. I don't mean the samples handed out on almost every aisle and the hassle of the lines as stereotypical fat people line up like hippos at a rotten carcass to 'just try a sample'. I mean the little restaurant inside the store where the hippos line up to drown their peptides in sugar and grease. The food at any CC is outstanding fast food at an unbelievably good price. The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean. Brave the parking and the neutral service because when you need a good hotdog/pizza/frozen yogurt, it's a great spot."
1,"I'm a little sad. I completed course II and have to wait a bit until I can take course III and it will be under the new Wilton format. I am very happy though that I have taken the cake decorating courses, meeting the nice people at the store and in my class. I've taken a very large interest in cake decorating and its part of my life now. :)\n\nI keep adding the cakes I've been making to my blog. http://www.carmeloricarde.com/"
1,"Cactus Moon is a nice little stop over by Cabela's on 202 and Dobson. I only go there to play poker with the Dream Dealers on Tuesdays. My regular order is  the pound of wings for $5 and then usually a Three Olive Vodka special. Lots of combos there, and all are tasty. There are TVs all around the place so now that baseball season is in swing you have no problems in seeing a game if its on. The service is friendly and the food comes up quick."
1,"I love my doc (Dr. Patterson). He takes the time to listen, answer questions and discuss treatment options. He's open minded, knowledgeable and makes me feel confident in his recommendations and insights. For that he's worthy of a 5-star rating.\n\nUnfortunately, he's typically 30-45 minutes (or more!) behind in the afternoons which means I have to take off a half day of work because there is no way to make it back to the office. For that, I feel compelled to only leave 4-stars for a doc that in every other way is a 5-star."
1,"Another visit to one of my favorite lunch-time haunts with my Zach. Can't stop trying the nachos, but have also branched out and tried the lengua tacos (yum) and some of the other specialties on the menu. I haven't been disappointed yet, and the place is always packed at lunchtime. So much better than most of the fast Mexican places out there and quite good prices. Once a week is not enough :)."
-1,"Friendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options.  Food is just okay, not great.  Makes me wonder why everyone likes Food Fight so much."
1,My family has been going to PV Eyecare for many years. We have never had any issue with the staff or Dr. Rios who is the best! Appointments are flexible and prices are competetive. This is a no pressure place- unlike other places. You can buy your frames/contacts  there or they will give you your prescription and you can go elsewhere. I am not familiar with any of the other doctors that are there but if you need a great eye doctor- try Dr. Rios.
1,"Love this place! \n\nGreat food, super cool ambiance and can you say, \""wine on tap\""? Doens't get much better than that."
-1,"Rude staff, almost made me feel like it was a bourden to them for me being in thier store.... thumbs down all around"
1,"I  would have to say this shop has guys that give a good haircut. My review would have been 5 stars but they lose a star for speed.  I  don't know if this is just how barbers cut in PHX but they are extremely slow while cutting your hair. Maybe I  am just used to getting a cut back east.  Everytime I go the staff is welcoming and friendly,  I  would recommend to my friends."
-1,"I feel like the owner had a bet as to how much money they could steal from a customer that day. I was charged for services I didn't ask for, quoted on other products that were so outrageous I almost threw up. $400 to change 2 radiator hoses? seriously? I'm talking about 2 belts that can be purchased for less than $30.  \n\nI was a long time customer that loved the service initially then found it to be more and more suspicious as time went buy. In the end you just knew you were getting ripped off, but it won't happen again. Go somewhere else."
-1,"Bought a Groupon and used #1 of 3.  Not sure I will go back to use the other 2. The food was not good at all. Ordered a cheeseburger, potato salad another bacon cheeseburger and Hawaiian coleslaw.  To drink we ordered a chocolate malt and a strawberry shake. The cheeseburgers were frozen patties and cooked clean into next week. Dry hockey pucks. The potato salad was ok the Hawaiian coleslaw was very blah.. The shake and malt were delicious even though they were not delivered until our burgers were finished. The waitstaff was like the walking dead, they had not an ounce of enthusiasm. When we sat down not one person acknowledged we were there. Waitress was not friendly either. No French fries!!! Potato salad, chips, coleslaw, carrot raisin salad. Wow! This place could be a goldmine, how about a friendly staff, and pattied burgers and if you can't have a deep fryer, how about some American Fries made from good old boiled potatoes. Put it this way, you get out of the place what you put into it and this place needs to step it up!"
-1,"The food was pretty good/decent,but the service is so lousy,the waiter for our table seemed lost,I asked for juice he brought me less than half a glass of pineapple juice later I asked for a glass of water ,the guy just disappeared never came with the water."
1,I few years back I worked around the block from MacAlpines. My coworkers and I would go there for lunch and several rounds of freshmade cherry cokes. YUMMM!!!! I miss those days!!
-1,"We have eaten here before and its one of my girlfriends favorite places and even though I am gluten free, I have always been able to manage in the past even though they don't have a \""gluten free\"" menu.  It was a friday night and we didnt have to wait to be seated which was amazing.  Our server however was very poor.  When i asked her about a gluten free menu (it had been over a year since i had been here so i figured i would ask just in case) - she replied with \""we dont have anything gluten free\"" .  I rephrased the question.. No we dont have anything gluten free.. I asked.. Salad? She replied oh yeah i guess that is gluten free.. so anyways.. I have been gluten free for a couple years now so i can pick out things i know i can eat and what i cant.  I ended up ordering.. Salad - no croutons please... of course, the salad came out with croutons... i sent it back asking for one without.  \nWings came out after entrees... \nfood was mediocre at best.  \nJust really not what i have come to expect."
1,Best Lobster Ravioli I have ever had.
-1,"Cream cheese skimp alert!! We pay ~$7 per smoked salmon bagel and they put the cream cheese on like people butter their toast. They have no clue what the word \""toasted\"" means. It really is just warming the bagel. The lox bagels are not even made open face. Not going back again."
1,"I have always had fresh food here. The service is nice and simple. \n\nI had the 2 Spicy tacos in soft corn shells, with cheese, sour cream, pico and lettuce. Served with chips and a drink for under 6 bucks. \n\nThe meat was good, not too spicy at all, the chips were a little greasy but I like that and the salsa bar was good. None of the salsa's were over the top good or hot. I suggest getting the \""super hot\"" from the people before you sit down. \n\nThe place was clean and the price was excellent."
-1,"Sad little place, even by Pittsburgh standards. Ambience of a funeral parlor, with average age of patrons about 69. Exemplary Calabria's dish? Oriental chicken salad garnished with uncooked ramen noodles."
-1,"If you want to get ripped off, belittled, and treated like garbage... then this is the place for you.  I RECOMEND NO ONE shop here.  Horrible business ethics all around."
-1,"Um...no!\n\nChips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - \""made in New York City?!?!?)\n\nI had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.\n\nOverall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.\n\nService was mediocre. \n\nMoral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome."
-1,"I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering."
1,"Delicious tacos! $6something for 3 tacos beans and rice and a mini salad. So good! Me and my husband both had the carne Assad tacos and they were good! My husband said his was kinda dry, but the flavor was there. Don't come here looking for a posh environment because it's not. It's a good ol taqueria and I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nParking lot is a little small, and it's kind of hard to spot the place at first glance but once you make it in there you'll be glad you tried them out! The red salsa is better than the green one, and they have Pepsi in a bottle! :)"
-1,"Perhaps my experience left me feeling bitter simply because I was not aware that you are supposed to cook your own steaks.... Wait, restaurant... cook my own food????\n\nMe and my dad went here because we were hungry for a steakhouse steak, but imagine our surprise when we walked in and our waitress explains how the restaurant works.  Oh, you can have the house chef cook the steak for you, but its $3 or something extra.... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me...  Well, we didn't come to cook, so we bit the bullet and got the chef to cook our food.  \n\nBut putting aside the whole \""cook your own steak\"" deal, the restaurant was still very poor to me.  The prices are absolutely ridiculous.  Every entree was above $20 and we didn't exactly get a ton of food.  My platter was a medium sized steak, a small baked potato, and a very small serving of veggie mix.  The salad bar was very poor.  Very limited selection, and the food looked old and wilted.  \n\nOur waitress was rarely around the whole night, and we even were placed on a side of the restaurant with barely any people.  This was especially troublesome based on how we were never given silverware, needed drink refills, and more napkin quite a few times.  Still, our waitress was never around.  \n\nTo be honest, most of the people in the restaurant weren't even eating...  It was mostly bar goers and people sitting around for drinks.   Not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least. \n\nAll and all, I won't be going back here.  Food wasn't bad, but it was very under-portioned and ridiculously over priced.  The service was bad at least on the night I went, the salad bar was very sub-par, and most of the people in the restaurant were just there for drinks.   I can't get into the \""cook my own steak\"" deal either.  Hell, I just would have stayed home and made my own steak for a 1/4 of the price."
-1,"I want to like this location for a number of reasons: they have a chef on site doing cooking demonstrations and handing out samples. The staff is really nice when it's crowded. They're a Market District location, so they've got a good amount of prepared (or 'oven-ready') foods. It's close to my house.\n\nBut going here is ALWAYS such a nightmare.\n\nThe parking lot is miserable. There's a tiny lot area, and then an underground parking garage, but both are a pain to navigate and find a space in. I have never been here when there wasn't a long wait at the deli (and the deli order machine is always down, so you really have no choice but to wait in the line). The aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size. \n\nThis store has a lot of potential, and it *is* the biggest GE in the immediate city area, but I always leave frazzled and anxious, so I'd rather just make the drive to the suburbs for my Giant Eagle shopping trip."
-1,"This place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money!! The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. \n\nSincerely,\n Matt K.\n\nHere is the response that I got\n\nPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThank you for making me aware of the situation.\nJoey DeMarco \n\nI promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money. Support local businesses, but make sure they are deserving of your money!"
1,"Alright seriously if you rate AJ's less than 5 than you're a buffoon.  Seriously think about this for a minute.  AJ's offers top quality products and specialty items that you can't find at your typical supermarket.  IE. Langoustines.  Is the store pricey? Yes, but you're paying for top quality products so I don't mind.  Their cheese selections blows any main competitor away as well as their prepared food.  I could go on forever breaking down each department, but I will not bore you.  Shell out the few extra dollars and shop here, you won't be disappointed!"
-1,Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service
-1,"Ordered for delivery..giving the information was painful. The person on the other line had an attitude and had trouble coping the information. I don't think I could have spoken any slower. I was told 35 min. Well 35 turned into 55. That extra 20 is an eternity when you have 3 hungry boys under 6yo. When I called back to see where it was I was again greeted with an attitude. Pleasant..right? Well we got to pizza, and it was cold. NEVER again. I'm going back to Danny's."
-1,"This is just sad. Half the stores are closed, and the other half are under rennovations. I walked away, as I was at the convention center, willing to spend a few shekles... and left annoyed at the state this center is in."
-1,"I did not have a great experience in this airport.  I think I came in through Terminal E, and it just reeked of mildew!  I hope that wing is next in line to get renovated.  \n\nOnce I moved towards the center, it was a lot cleaner looking, but I wasn't crazy about the food selection.  Cinnabon, BBQ, pizza with 4 slices of tomato on it and that's it?  It's tough to be a vegetarian in NC, I guess.  And the lines for the food were ghastly!  Anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line.  I guess I could have had a 5,000 calorie cinnamon bun for lunch.\n\nAnd yes, I gave an extra star for free wifi."
-1,"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the selection on the menu, as it offers food you cant really find anywhere else in the C-U.  I thought the menu items were decently priced, maybe a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food.  \n\nI ordered three tapas dishes - the grilled plantains, the goat cheese, and the beef tacos.  The goat cheese was fried and served with honey and bread and it was absolutely delicious!  The plantains were pretty plain, but still a nice change of pace from what I normally eat day to day.  The beef tacos were tasty, but they were incredibly hard to eat when served in dry corn shelled tortillas.  They cracked and fell apart so it was a bit frustrating to end up having to eat a taco with a fork.  \n\nOur service was absolutely terrible, I had to flag down the host at one point to get my water glass refilled, and she brought out all of our food at different times which was a bit strange.  \n\nOverall, I was happy with the food I ordered and how it was prepared and how it tasted - were talking about Champaign, Illinois, not Chicago or New York - and unhappy with the service.  I wouldn't tell someone not to go there, because it is a unique restaurant for this area, but I would be warned that the service will likely be disappointing."
-1,"Just went to grab a quick lunch to go and must say this is the wrost prepared food to date. I've gone hear at least 30 times before and this is the first time that I can honestly say it sucked. They weren't really busy, since I went at 10:30 am. I hope this isn't a new trend."
-1,"Yesterday, my daughter and I were given free tickets to see \""The Whispers!\""  As she's never been there before and her birthday is this coming Sunday, I thought why not celebrate?\n\nThe ticket said that we had to arrive before 6:30 to not revert to paying $15 apiece, so we arrived at 6 pm.  Parking is $5, collected as soon as you arrive.  If you want to avoid the mad rush getting outta there, strategically park near the exit (or near where you entered).\n\nThe line wasn't terribly long but the wait for the 8:30 show (2.5 hours)  was unendurable .  If you use either a walker or wheel chair, I don't believe this place is handicap accessible as I saw no ramps for either.  You only have the option to walk upstairs or downstairs.  The facility had minimal air conditioning and with the crowd it was very hot both inside and outside on the patio.  You would think they' would at least have a mist sprinkler system outside along with more chairs!  Also, you could see the patio is desperately in need of structural repairs. Obviously, the facility expected us to buy drinks while we waited.  But who wants to drink over priced alcohol drinks when you're uncomfortably hot and dehydrated? \n\nWhile everyone raves about getting a good view from any seat, the seats themselves are packed closely together.  I'm 5'5\"" and my knees were scrunched by the seat in front of me.  Also if you've heavyset, the seats are small.  Acoustics are good. And I've had yet to attend an event here that starts on time???\n\nOverall, I'd avoid this place.  If you must go, remember:  You get what you pay for."
1,"I'm relatively new to town and was searching for a great spot to get an oil change. After reading reviews and calling a couple places to inquire about pricing, I selected Avis Lubrication.\n\nWhen I arrived, a friendly gentleman met me at my car and asked if I had ever visited the shop. He then asked me a few simple questions about myself (name, address, etc.) and my car (year, make, etc.) Within five minutes, my vehicle was being pulled into the bay and being worked on. I found this impressive considering there were two cars ahead of me. While one employee changed the oil, another was washing the windows and checking the tire pressure. \n\nAfter my experience at Avis Lubrication, I can definitely say I'll be back. These guys are courteous, prompt and efficient. Within twenty minutes of pulling up (and paying less than I was quoted at other highly reviewed spots), I was on my way. Thank you, Avis!"
1,"I purchased a voucher from Living Social; $10 for $20 towards food.  I'd gitten a sweet PayPal deal a while back and we enjoyed the pizza so I bought this voucher.  I am so pleased that I did.  We sat in a bck booth (luckily away from the live musician).  We ordered baked ziti and spinach lasagna.   The hubby go a sald yo go with his ziti and I got Reisling with my spinach lasagna.  The dishes came piping hoy and cheesy.   The hubby's ziti was the perfect texture, sauce amoubt and crispy cheese was amazing.  My loaded spinach lasagna was firm, full of spichach and covered in cheese.  I have to say the salad and wine were noyhing spectacular but functional.   The garlic toast was soft and buttery as well.  The service was adequate; perhaps a little slow even though it wasn't super busy.  The biggest complaint the live musician who was a good background music piano player but when he sang it was embarrassing.   He wad not good.  Would have been had he not sung at all.  Otherwise it was a terrific Friday night dinner out."
-1,"I am being utterly polite by giving this place one star. Places where I've had better food: the cafeteria in a hospital, 7-11, if I'd ever been to prison, prison. I'm not sure if Jordan's pays people to park in its lot to give the impression that the place is full. There's absolutely nothing authentically Mexican about this place, except, perhaps, for the Mexican dishwasher.  If you've recently lost your tase buds, love greasy beef dumped into a Old El Paso \""taco shell\"" topped with shredded Velveeta and iceberg lettuce, then, boy is this the place for you. Also, if you're a fan of tomato paste in the guise of \""salsa\"" and served from a stolen syrup container from IHOP, then do it up at Jordan's.\n\nPlease, do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and eat at the Jack-in-the Box down the street. You've been warned."
1,Great breakfast spot. Tons of lovely options. Everything is big portions. I love the green eggs and ham as well as the mile high omelette.
-1,"Went there a few weeks ago to get some emergency plumbing parts. A guy who was \""there to help\"" didn't have a clue then some loud kid who couldn't be bothered to take his ear buds out of his head was a total jerk. I have been coming here for years but  I wouldn't come here if you need any kind of advice or come here during the day when the adults are working. \n\nOn the other hand they sell ammo and they normally have a ton of it."
-1,"Called to make sure they could change my watch battery. Was told to \""come on in\"". I get there and there is no parking and I'm expected to leave my watch for a few hours. Really? There was NOTHING going on inside. Friendly...yea but my watch still doesn't work. This is why the mall gets all the business."
-1,"I have been in this place several times and have had mixed experience. The service here is not so great. I had a question about a video game for my nephew and I felt like I was putting the clerk off by asking questions. The store was a bit disorganized, but I would expect that for a Saturday afternoon."
1,"This is one of those hidden hot spots in Phoenix that people don't know about, but should. The beer is excellent and the service was top notch. Really I would give this place a 4 1/2. Boyfriend and I both had burgers, which were meaty and juicy without being greasy. I ordered the beer sampler, which was a great choice for a first timer. Overall this place is great!!"
-1,"Used to be so good...but the food and service has deteriorated in the last few years.\n\nCarpaccio....one of my favorite items on their menu is now served without toast points. You must request them...then they only bring a few. Last time it was served on a very hot plate...by the time we got the toast, some if the carpaccio was cooked. Horrible.\n\nI have enjoyed the venison dish in the past...it was always tender and succlent. Last visit, it was so rare and chewey I could not enjoy it. I asked the waitress about it, and she replied, \""They've always cooked it rare\"". \n\nThe crab cakes: I know that most German menus probably don't include crab cakes! But, most nice restaurants do, so it is pretty standard fare. Their crab cakes are very crabby, but also include either tuemeric or curry, which is entirely unexpected, and does not add to the dish.\n\nTheir famous salad: The Waldhorn salad, baby greens towering over delicious cucumber salad, orzo salad, carrot salad and delicious german potato salad. This dish is just amazing! For us, it is the only reason to return to Waldhorn's!\n\nBring your own water, service is spotty most times....and I've observed that we aren't always the only ones with empty glasses!\n\nWe've liked Waldhorn for over 10 years....but this weekend was probably our last visit."
1,I wasn't familiar with this small chain until I traveled to the Southwest last year.  Elephant Bar was a welcome find when I visited one near Albuquerque last December.  The menu is diverse ranging from salads to sandwiches to stir fry to entrees.  I have tried a selection from each of the menu sections and I have always enjoyed my food at the Elephant Bar.\n\nStaff is trained well and very informed about the menu choices.  I like the casual atmosphere of each Elephant Bar and I find them good for lunch meetings.\n\nManager Leo at this Scottsdale location is welcoming and attentive to details throughout the restaurant.  Elephant Bar is along something of a restaurant row on Mayo.  Parking is plentiful and the restaurant is easy to find off of Scottsdale Road.
-1,"Apparently yelp decided to remove my original review \""because it lacks a firsthand customer experience\"".  Well, I've had a few \""firsthand customer experiences\"" at Hyatt's.  I just couldn't buy anything there because it was all too bloody expensive!  Use the internet or drive over to Matthews and go to Fire Power.  It will be worth it!"
-1,"PLEASE, if anyone has recently experienced food poisoning symptoms after visiting this establishment (around June 25-27, 2014) PLEASE CALL: Paola at (602) 506-7171 to report your experience. We do not want anyone else to become ill. 11 people from our party have already become very sick. Thank you."
1,"My mom has been a regular at Ide Mania for years and also takes my 17 year old brother with curly hair there, but they don't Yelp.  She absolutely loves this place so it's always the go-to place for gift certificates for her birthday, Mother's Day, and Christmas.  My family was even nice enough to get me a gift certificate which I was used for an amazing 1-hour spa pedicure and a bunch of products.  Every time I've gone in there for gift certificates, to stop in and say Hi to my Mom while she's getting her hair done, or for products they've always been so funny, warm, professional and nice.\n\nMy mom and brother who go there both have curly hair and Lettie knows exactly what to do and how to make their hair look the way they want.   My 17 year old brother has been able to grow out his curly hair from short to about to a little above the shoulders, but it's cut/shaped really well so it always looks really good even between haircuts."
1,"Buffet only on Friday!! And today is Wednesday :*(\n\nI went based on other yelp reviews, and it was pretty good.\n\nNot gourmet or anything, and it is a grocery store, but I tend to like this sort of thing and feel more at home, like you're at someone's house at the table in the kitchen.\n\nI got the gyro plate with a few salads on the side.  It's reasonably priced and they serve it with warm pita bread.\n\nNext time I will ask for more salads and less meat (just my personal preference), but everything was tasty. And the tsatziki sauce was yum yum yum.\n\nI'll come back on Friday and check out the buffet.  (Only 12-4!)"
-1,"As a new yelper, I feel the need to span the star spectrum, but I really had a hard time trying to think of a 1.  Then I remembered a little voyage I took last fall, coupon in hand, to Zoe's, which is right between my apartment and work.  The coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase.  Thank God I had that coupon, becuase I would have been pissed if I had actually payed $7.50 for a \""spinach quesadilla\"" which was cream cheese and cooked spinach between two tortillas.  I could have made it better for $.45 at home.  \nThen I actually went back again to give it a second chance (I had a lot of coupons) and ate a very boring sandwich with cafeteria stlye mashed potatoes.   Maybe this place would be better for non vegetarians....my coworker liked his Greek Chicken plate, (liked, not loved)....it may go up to 2 or 3 stars for carnivores."
-1,"I went with a party of four, and was the only one not to order the chicken fried steak - - rather, my heart was set on chicken fried chicken.  Now, I'm not a gravy person, so I ordered my chicken w/o gravy.  This was the most flavorless piece of fried chicken I've ever eaten.  The breading had ZERO seasoning in it, and the chicken was not seasoned.  While it was moist, it required generous amounts of tabasco to make it edible.  What a let down.  The buttermilk biscuit was good...and that was all I'd describe as above average."
-1,"This is a very odd restaurant.  I was here once and probably won't be back.  The people who work here were doing a lot of screaming at each other, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant but our food took about 45 minutes to come, and the quality of the food wasn't that great.  You can definitely get better Vietnamese elsewhere in the city.\n\nWith all the wonderful dining options in the Strip, I'm confused as to how this place survives."
-1,"Get ready to walk or run, whichever. I have flown in and out of CLT about 1000 times, usually on a connection. CLT is very large, and you will use about 10 moving sidewalks, and escalators. They do have nice rocking chairs spread throughout, however I doubt you will have time to lavish the slow life. The food is okay at best, mostly fast food, as all airports. \n\nThe 2 stars for me comes from the massive delays on the runway. You WILL sit on the airplane in a big huge line waiting to take off, or you will wait for an open gate for your plane to park. That gets annoying. In addition, the runways are really long, so it makes for a LONG taxi. \n\nI always joke and say when you are flying from CLT you will feel like the plane is driving to the destination not flying."

1,"Let's start with THIS is my playground. It's a frickin gym. Nothing special. It's centrally located, clean and available to me at all the hours I want to go bully the weights. I am not into the classes (explains the one star deficit), but will tell you everything you need to know about kicking the weights around. The weights are plenty though some machines could get more maintenance upkeep due to their popularity, ie the leg machines. The rows of cardio machines are plenty for those of you looking to up your heart rate. Though with the mix of hot yuppies, uber models, beefcakes, the eye candy around is enough motivation to work out without being bored. It is located in the Biltmore/Arcadia area...what do you expect? My fave room is the ab room which has a variety of equipment for you to work on your core and spacious enough without being violated by your neighbor's sweat or wandering eyes. I like that the bathrooms are on the lower level from the rest of the gym so it's not like I have to do a runway walk to change into my gymrat gear. Lockers are readily available with easy access to the sauna, steam room and lap pools. Warning, the hot tub is a hotbed for really bad pick up lines. \n\nLike anywhere else, the busy days and peak times you may find yourself waiting on benches or machines. The gym could have updates here and there but the staff is good about addressing issues. I feel like the cleaning crew is always ensuring spotlessness, in fact they work out there too! The trainers are all friendly and approachable as are the patrons if you need to ask about any equipment use or suggestions on varying your routine. For the monthly membership, I have no complaints."
-1,"disappointing.\n\nserver was nice and pretty attentive but that's about all good i can say about this place.\n\nwe ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks that were pretty decent but nothing to rave over.  while we were still eating them, our tomato basil soup arrived so i had to juggle which one i wanted to eat before they got cold.  it turns out, i didn't much care for the soup so that was an easy choice.\n\nmid-way through the appetizer/soup course, viola!  our main course arrived.  i admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to get food before i'm ready for it.. so that's a big part of why this restaurant is not my favorite.\n\nhowever, the dishes we got weren't particularly good either.\ni got the spinach chicken ravioli with marinara on three and alfredo on the other three.  the chicken didn't seem quality and it was stuck in the raviolis in chunks and it distracted from the consistency of it as a dish.\n\nmy beau's steak was inedible.  his first bite was gristle -- so much so that he had to spit it back out.  he only managed to gnaw through half the steak .. and i think he did that only because he was so hungry.  he asked for it medium-rare and it came so rare that, if it was me, i would have definitely sent it back to be cooked more.\n\noverally, i was just disappointed by benvenuto's.  \nbummer."
-1,"I live 5 minutes away, food took 1.5 hours to get here. Generals chicken was sub par at best.. Everything else wasn't. No thank you"
1,"I've been coming to Rainbow for years.  They do a good job cleaning my stuff, and they are reasonably priced.  The staff is friendly and I've never had a problem getting any issues I have resolved with them."
-1,"We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say, the best part was the complimentary valet parking!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm, thinking the restaurant would be packed, only to find it about a quarter full.  Did we go to the right place?  From what I had heard, I expected there to be a line out the door like there was both times we went to Chima for past Restaurant Weeks.  It's a nice looking place, very open yet cozy, and it has a great bar area.  The server, John, was great and took good care of us, so no complaints there.  It was the food that was lackluster, and for the money, I wish we had gone elsewhere.  The bread was fresh and a good start (2 kinds, and a spread with olives as well as an oil and balsamic vinaigrette to wet it down). The Fattouch salads were good, though I question the use of iceberg lettuce for presentation as it looked like a low end salad with some red peppers, olives and a nasty tomato thrown in.  My partner had a Flat Iron Steak which he ordered medium well and got medium rare.  The first few bites were good, but it toughened as it cooled, and he had some difficulty cutting it as well as the asian broccoli (which he gave up on).  Being a vegan, I wasn't sure I would find anything to eat, but i did see a Mushroom Bolognese pasta dish that I ended up ordering.  It had a great taste, but the homemade pasta was a bit al dente and stuck together.  More like the wide rice noodles in some asian dishes.  Still, I enjoyed mine.  No vegan desert option for me (fresh fruit option, please?), but my partner ordered the chocolate cake and said it was good but very rich.  It all seemed to disappear, though, so that says something!  Overall, a decent dining experience, if we were spending maybe $40-50 max, tip included.  $30 each plus 2 iced teas ($6.98) and tip came to just under $90.  At least I felt like I got my one's worth with the valet at $5 for a tip, it saved me $1 off parking myself and then walking a block!  Still, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  With all the great dining our city has, I think there are better choices for the money...Ilios Noche comes to mind for great atmosphere, service and menu selection at about $20-25 less, and then we could still catch a movie!"
-1,Not food network worthy yet they claim Guy has been there and loved it was highly unimpressed not going back ever
-1,"Enterprise. First time because AMEX for whatever reason didn't book National this time. They even told me it was the same company which is clearly not the case.\n\nArriving, the guy propose me all the insurance that I have to take. It increases the price of the renting by 3... (400$ to +1200$) So from cheap prices AMEX told me, I got a 3 times higher bill now.\n\nNot that I am not aware of this kind of situation but in the case of Enterprise, there will be a difference when you arrive to the car. National use to give for the same price a middle to full car size. Enterprise will just give you a small car you \""asked\"" for for the small price which is now with the insurance a full size car price.\n\nWe also wanted to change the credit card used to pay. Call Enterprise desk put on hold forever. Send an e-mail to the leasing agent that gave me his card, never got an answer.\n\nThe car didn't have any problem. Only positive thing.\n\nSo for resume:\nFor the National price, you get at Enterprise a small car with no people willing to help you once you swiped your credit card."

1,What a great business. I've had mufflers added to my 1988 Mustang that sounded great. I had a stolen catalytic converter replaced on my 1999 Toyota 4 runner.\nboth times he did excellent work for a really good price. I highly recommend Mad Hatter.\nHe even said that I could bring in some rebar from home depot and he would weld it onto the new cat converter to prevent any future theives from stealing.
-1,Do not eat here. Terrible.
-1,"I first visited this zoo yesterday. My expectations were too high apparently, because honestly it was the worst zoo experience I have ever had. Maybe I am spoiled....the zoo I grew up going to \""Reid Park Zoo\"" in Tucson is 20 times better!\n\nThe animal selection was pathetic. The only thing that impressed me was the enclosures are large, which is great for the animals, but the variety is lacking. I do not recommend going during the afternoon on a hot day. The animals were all hiding and sleeping to avoid the heat.\n\nBring your own food/water!!! This place is GOUGING it's guests!! $3 for a bottle of soda!!!! The prices for the snack bars are astronomical! $6 for a HOT DOG! OUCH!\n\nI do not have plans of ever going back to this zoo, from now on I will take the 100 mile trip to Tucson, and will likely end up spending LESS (with gas included) than at the Phoenix Zoo."
-1,"we are familiar with Popey's (West coast version of this restaurant) so we thought, great! Landed late at the airport, let's go get some of their famous Dirty Rice, Fried chicken and fixings.  When we finally reached the order box at the drive through order station, the young lady's voice kept cutting in and out of the speaker.  We thought :\""well there must be something wrong with the microphone or their speaker box and continued on to pay. As we reached the payment window a man was at the window asking for $7 for the supreme meal, we said, \""no, we ordered the 12pc chicken with dirty rice, you know your supreme package with all the fixings.  He walks away waves his hand and yells at someone to come take the order right, this young african american comes up, asks why we dont want the supreme meal box and continually shuts the service window on us as we are trying to tell her we ordered the family meal. She turns around slams the window shut again and throws her hands up and walks off with this attitude!  Never comes back or to tell us what the price of the meal is going to be...she just abandoned us at the pick up window!  We have never been to this side of the state before....is this how you all treat your customers? No wonder Disney World is making a killing in this side of the woods!  There's got to be better employees than this...\n\nSuffice it to say we will NEVER eat at your restaurants in this area if your employees are this horrible to their customers.  We will not frequent any of your businesses here because of your poor training methods."
-1,"I agree with another poster on the review about Village Pizza being compared to Dominos. I have to say tag lines of \""Real Italian Food\"" caught my eye and sparked my interest. unfortunately, I was let down. There is nothing authentically Italian about this eatery. Staff was upbeat and nice , pizza buffet was sparse and pizza looked old. It was right around dinner time , so if anything, that's when the buffet should  be stocked with choices.  We ordered a pizza with meatball and pepperoni, and a side of mozzarella sticks. Sauce was decent and sticks were good, toppings were fresh. It's convenient, if you live in the area, but I don't understand all the hype."
-1,"Light your torches and get the pitchforks, because I'm not shy about writing scathing reviews on some of Pittsburgh's beloved restaurants. I don't enjoy doing it.  I love our city and I think our diverse restaurant choices make us a great place to live and visit. But when I hear great things about a place only to be consistently let down, I have no choice.  That being said, I'm going to have to rip Harris Grill a new one. \n\nI waited a long time before reviewing Harris Grill.  I've been there loads of times; happy hours, bacon night, brunch, crowded Friday nights, and not-so-crowded Monday nights.  Almost every time I have been let down. \n\nI'll break it down. \n\nDRINKS: The drink menu and draft lift offer a solid list of (overpriced) choices.  That's fine.  What isn't so fine is that the bartending is inconsistent and I have too often received ill-concocted highballs and sangria that tastes like Franzia.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but almost every time I'm there at least one or two beer taps \""aren't working.\"" \n\nAPPETIZERS: Nothing really wrong here.  Good spinach and buffalo chicken dips, the \""Britney Spears\"" (chicken strips), and hummus are all very tasty. Thumbs up.\n\nMAIN COURSES: I guess it depends on your taste, but I am simply not enthralled by any of the entrees.  The salads are overpriced for their small size, their highly touted macaroni and cheese is bland, and their chicken quesadillas are NOT quesadillas.  Just about everything on the menu at Harris Grill is overpriced for the quality.  $17 dollars for homemade hamburger helper?  $16 for two fish tacos? \n\nI don't HATE anything on the Harris Grill menu.  Their entrees are between \""ok\"" and \""good.\"" Just overpriced.  I do enjoy the Henny Penny and as I said before, all of the appetizers.  I'd give them a 3-star review if it wasn't for the....\n\nSERVICE:  Or lack thereof.  Sure, Harris Grill gets crowded, especially on the weekends.  That does not excuse the waitstaff from being rude and ignoring their tables for upwards of an hour.  On one occasion, our server clearly forgot about us and we watched astounded as tables seated long after us were brought their meals.  When we finally did inquire about our food,  the waiter made a beeline for the computer to put in our orders.  No apologies, no offer to comp a side or a dessert.  In fact, the check was rushed to us before we even finished our food because the restaurant had a long waiting list.  Bad form, Harris Grill. What makes it worse is that I've been here many times, and have had similar problems with the service. \n\nBut truth be told, I'll probably be back.  Because I really want to like Harris Grill. Moreover, my friends love Harris Grill and I love my friends.  I just sincerely hope they hire more competent waitstaff.  Revising their menu wouldn't be a bad idea, either..."
1,"Very Nice Nike outlet. I mean come on who doesn't love Nike... and doesn't love them at a cheaper price??! \n\nThis store has a great selection, always have stuff on sale ontop of the cheaper prices."
1,Great pizzas for very reasonable prices.
-1,"Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again."
-1,"On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses, pants, etc but they charged me for the items. Not happy. I've decided that im not coming back to this place."
1,"This place was expensive, but you also get what you pay for, and it was worth every cent."
1,"This place is always empty, and I do not see why?\n\nThe Triple Prime burgers are fantastic, and well prices. The french fries are also great. This is one of my fav places to eat burgers, and I am not a supporter of chains. I ate here on a whim one day, and was very impressed.\n\nIf you are a burger fan (and by that I mean someone who like a burger that tastes great without a ton of toppings, you enjoy the beef) order the Triple Prime burger, you will love it.\n\nAs one reviewer also noted, they have a large selection of really good lemonades and teas, and they are not the usual chain variety. \n\nOverall I really enjoy the quiet, good service."
-1,"The service was nice, friendly and fast.\n\nI'm giving it a 1 star for the food and price. It literally tasted and looked like everything came out of a old can. The consistency was real weird on every level. Probably the worst BBQ food I've ever had. I don't know how else to put it. But if you can avoid it, you should.\n\nIt was real expensive for the quality of food too. It was $18 for a standard pulled pork plate with a drink. \n\nSeriously so bad. But they were friendly and nice. That's about it though. \n\nSorry bubba, you need a makeover. You're giving NC BBQ a bad rep."
1,"I literally just came upon this coffee shop thanks to Yelp!, and thank goodness.  I've been searching for an amazing cup of coffee and I found it.\n\nI'm pretty sure the owner was the amazingly helpful and nice lady working behind the counter, (I saw her picture in an article posted on the wall). She was great.\n\nMy coffee was amazing, nicely priced, and extremely fast.\n\nI will be returning and spreading the word!"
-1,"Well Merc. You have let me and my friends down. I have gone to you over the years while living in the Biltmore/Arcadia area and  have recommended you time and time again to people who want a 'ultra lounge feel' as opposed to a 'club like feel'. Well. After arriving for happy hour last week we had the entire Merc Bar to ourselves at about 430pm and the bartender swiftly brought us a menu and waters. Nice! However, that awesome service went downhill fast and the decibel level of your 90's Culture Club and New Edition beats went way up at the same rate. Soon my two friends and I were yelling our conversation to each other! ' What?!! What?!!! OH right?!! ' Yes. I am not making this up. That music was loud & out of character for what I 'thought ' was a cool, swanky, hip, ittle ultra lounge. I'm thinking some jazz, maybe ?? Or at least some Michael Buble? At a level where your patrons can talk in a voice to each other that doesn't cause laryngitis the next day! We would eventually figure out as Merc began to fill up , that there was a group meeting here this particular day. There were so many, in fact, we could not make our way to the restroom without pushing thru physically. We never saw the cocktail waitress, and that meant we never got our waters refilled after that bartender brought us our initial glass. At any rate , our drink that our once attentive bartender gave us was called the Double A. It was a mix of tequila , grapefruit juice , raspberries , lemon and bitters. It was good! I won't deny that you have amazing fresh ingredient drinks made with premium liquors! That said, we would have stayed and ordered more , but the cocktail waitress had to be flagged down by going to the bar  , ( and fighting the Meet Up crowd again), and telling the bartender we wanted our bill. She came twenty minutes later and we were overcharged for our drinks. Fail. We went back to bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets! We felt that trying to 'fight' over a few bucks wasn't worth the effort of the crowd, the loud music and all of the frustration. Oh. MY. I give you a two based on your drink being unique and fresh and that is all. What you used to be, Merc Bar, I hope you can be again!"
1,"We go to Jupes all the time! We love this place!!! Chris and Carrie are awesome, the beer is frosty and cheap and we love that its a neighborhood bar. The trivia night (Thursday) is so fun and they have a great juke box."
1,"Great 'mom & pop' spot.  I always come here and I've never had a bad experience. \n\nThe place looks to be an old Filiberto's building but the inside is really nice.  The plants, decor, music, and the sound of running water from a little fountain makes this place very relaxing and comforting. \n\nI've tried a few different things on the menu and while not everything is great, the teriyaki chicken is on point. Never fails me. Plus the owners are always nice.  This is one of those places that I default to when I can't decide on where to have my lunch."
1,"This zoo just keeps getting better, and better. I've been to this zoo almost every other year since I was 4 years old. I'm 23 now.\n\nI'm planning another \""back to Arizona\"" trip, since I moved away from AZ for about 5 years, and missed AZ so much that I just HAD to come back. I went to the Kansas Zoo, and wow, was it HORRIBLE! There was next to nothing compared to the Phoenix Zoo. I remember going and hearing people say how Amazing it was, then after actually going to it, it made me miss and appreciate the Phoenix Zoo even more. \n\nThis place is huge, and has a really cute lay out. I don't know why so many people said it was a bad lay out, or not a good zoo. Everytime I've went, the animals were out and about. We even saw bear cubs wrestling with each other while the mother/father watched. A white bird kept saying \""hello pretty\"" to me, and \""no!\"" to my brother, hahaha.  \n\nThey now have the up close giraffe exhibit, as someone else mentioned. They never had that when I was growing up, so I'm really excited to go and see how that is.\n\nI give this zoo a 5/5 stars, because I've never once had a problem. For the people complaining about strollers, I completely agree but it's expected when people have so many kids now a days :( Makes it sort of hard for the ones that don't have kids to enjoy stuff when you have 5 kids and 3 strollers in front of you, or on your toes. \n\nThe gift shops are great! Sure, they may be a tad overpriced, but when are gift shops not over priced? Exactly.\n\nDon't forget zoo lights. I don't know of any other Zoo's that have it, but if you have a zoo with zoo lights, consider yourself lucky, and go to one immediately . If you don't have one, come to the Phoenix Zoo around Christmas time, and see the zoo lights. It's so pretty, and puts you in such a great Christmas mood. It definitely brings out the Christmas now a days, since most people don't seem to decorate or celebrate it as much, anymore =("
1,"I've been to a lot of airports and I have to say that I think Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is probably one of the most user friendly. They need to do some work in baggage claim, with better signage and maybe see what can be done to speed up luggage delivery, but the gate areas and shopping are pretty darn good. I like parking in the garage but it's a bit pricey for me and the economy lot parking shuttles are too slow for my taste. So I either get a ride or use an off airport parking lot as they seem to be faster. if you have a long lay over, there is plenty to keep you entertained while at Sky Harbor."
1,"I love it here, and even though I'm moving across town soon, I will always continue to bring my pet cat here.  The vet is wonderful.  He's very honest and you can tell that he really loves animals.  The woman who runs the front desk is very polite and always on top of things.  They were also considerate of my financial situation and didn't try to sell me vaccines that my cat didn't need.  They were very up front about pricing.  I love it here and I'm so glad I found this place.  I trust my kitty in their hands :)"
-1,"The coffee here is atrocious. My \""latte\"" looks like someone took the government-funded chocolate milk we were fed as kids, and cut it with chalk-water. It tastes like someone forgot to remember to put the coffee grounds in the espresso machine, and all that came out was the grime residue on the inside of the pipes that got blasted off by scalding water. Then they took a huge vat of skim milk and burned the crap out of it and mixed it with water. They combined the two in my cup. I asked for less milk, hoping to be able notice some coffee flavor. But I still have a 10-oz. cup of flavorless grey water."
-1,"I hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole. My car was broken into here in broad daylight. There's always unsavory characters lolling about, and that's just the people that work there. They roll one distrustful eye up towards you (the other obscured by emo fringe) and glare at you for even daring to disturb them. As for the people that shop here, if you stand too close, you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot. Every time I come here, without fail, there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter, trying to convince them they just \""lost\"" their written prescription for Vicodin, or their Percocets got \""stolen\"", all with Emmy-award winning shows of anguish and pain. So you're asking now why I even come here, and I don't blame you. I work long hours, and this is the closest 24-hour pharmacy to my humble abode. Sometimes, a girl doesn't have time to  drive to a first-world facility. What can I do, except clutch my bag extra close, scared-old-lady style, and take an extra long shower with extra disinfecting soap when I get home."
1,"I absolutely love this pizza.  This is my comparison place when I try other places and I'm still saying Nello's is better.  I've never had a bad pizza here.  Their thin crust pizza is the best and they don't overdo the sauce, so you can still taste the bread of the pizza. Of course the staff is always friendly. Bonus part is being able to have a good red wine here with the pizza. Yum."
-1,"Ordered a Bean and Cheese Burrito the other night in the drive-thru, didn't know I mistakingly ordered the Lard and Cheese Burrito. Three of the worst dollars I've ever spent.\n\nAs far as drive-thru Mexican places I've given a try in my day (and I've given a few too many a try), this might be the worst.\n\nI've yet to find a really good dirty taco shop around downtown, but the Filberto's by Glam is a lot better."
-1,"Not worth your money.  Poor service, worn interior, A/C was non-functional, THE CD PLAYER DIDN'T WORK, AND THERE WAS NO AUXILIARY JACK.\n\nThey get two start because they managed to get us from Point A to Point B without making us fear for our lives."
1,"Great culinary experience. Greg, the owner, is very personable. Enjoyed the live music and the whole warm feeling of the restaurant...great food and great wine."
1,"Wonderful! Hailing from the Midwest, I've always loved desert flora and fauna because it's so radically different from what I grew up with. A few hours at the Desert Botanical Garden really indulged my fascination. Grab a sunhat, a camera and set aside a few hours to wander the trails here. It's truly a delightful experience. Besides all the amazing plantlife, I saw myriad birds, a lizard, a jackrabbit and some other kind of tree rodent thing, though I sadly did not catch a glimpse of desert tortoise. I guess I'll just have to go back!"
1,Great service and they had what I came for. Some work boots. Rand H. and I called in first to make sure they had what we were looking for and they did indeed. Big 5 Gets my big 5 stars!
1,"We had a great experience here from start to finish. The service was exceptional and we tried one of their specialty pastas that had prosciutto, Spicy sausage and ricotta cheese. We shared a small and had leftovers for dinner the next day. Garlic bread rounded out our meal and unfortunately had no room for dessert though it looked wonderful as well. \nLove the warmth and decor of this place and hope to return sometime soon."
-1,"I met some friends here for lunch, the menu is a weird mosh of Italian, Mexican and American food....it is almost like they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be. \n\nI ordered the cheese enchiladas which was probably the wrong choice at a non-Mexican restaurant, but I just wasn't feeling anything else. The two people who were with me got their food, and I was still waiting, and waiting and waiting. Finally the waitress came over and asked if anyone had been here to talk to me...isn't that her job? She said that they gave my dish to someone else by accident, so they are making me a \""fresh\"" plate. \n\nMy enchiladas finally arrive, and look like they were just slopped on the plate. i take a bite and guess what? They were barely warm! You would think that a \""fresh\"" plate would be served piping hot! I took a few bites, but by now I was over them and late for a meeting. \n\nA waitress that was different than ours brought over our check, which included my enchiladas. I told her what the problem was, but she didn't seem to speak English very well and said she would go ask someone. They did take them off the bill, but that really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table were done with their food before I even got mine! \n\nThe decor is odd too, it is like they are trying to be a sports bar, but maybe aren't sure, evidenced by the 6 plasma TVs sitting in the corner still in their boxes! \n\nIf I have a say in the matter....I won't be returning to Deemos."
1,"First off, like what Daren below me wrote, there are 2 Casey Jones's. One offers up free UFC, and this one offers up an incredible local beer selection , and some decent food to go along with it. \n\nIt's a sports bar, and it does it well. And they carry everything, including stuffed pizza sticks, nachos, and my personal favorite, fried cheese curds.\n\nYes, fried cheese curds. Balls of wonder. \n\nGo for the beer, the tv's, and trivia on Thursdays. \n\nParking is horrific."
-1,"Tried takeout yesterday. One of the worst Indian meals we have had in a long time.\n- Lamb Kabobs - undercooked and falling apart. They may have run out of time or maybe they had too many takeout orders. No excuse. A big F for this.\n- Chicken Makhni - C minus. tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish. Very small portion. \n- Saag Paneer - C+ The paneer tasted rubbery. Good flavor though.\n\nOne can understand, this is Charlotte and thus not a Indian food destination. But the miss on simple Kabobs clearly show a careless staff. Charlotte deserves better.\n\nIn my opinion, a waste of money."
-1,"This place is slimey as all heck & a disgrace to the KIA brand.  I chose to go to this dealership because I was under the pretense of a false trade-in promotion.  Their claimed minimum trade-in value does not pertain to the vast majority of their car lot. Their selection is extremely weak (they only carrying a handful of each model).  \n\nIn the last decade I've purchased cars from the Independence Carmax (twice), Scott Clark Toyota & Hilbush Ford.  I prefer all of them over Folger Kia."
1,"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants that reminds me a lot of the little Italian family style restaurants you can find in little Italy and other places around NYC. I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!"
1,"While visiting family in Mesa for the week, my husband and I decided to spend one (rare) rainy afternoon going bowling. A quick Internet search led us to AMF Lanes. Though the reviews weren't stellar, we are far from bowling alley connoisseurs so we were confident that this place would meet our needs. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it well exceeded expectations! The price was very reasonable, only $8 for all you can bowl until 5:00! The woman working the counter was extremely friendly and helpful too. Dan the bartender (and fellow northerner, Michigan to be exact but we don't hold that against him), was quick with our beers and enjoyable to talk to. He even made rounds over to the lanes to check on the bowlers and to ask if they needed anything. The place was clean, played fun music, and had a nice afternoon crowd but was not overly packed. All in all it was a fun and affordable activity and we definitely plan to return when we are back in town. Thanks AMF Mesa Lanes!"
-1,"Never been treated so poorly\n\nI went with three friends to eat at Tessaro's on a rainy Saturday evening.  I dropped them off while I parked the car.  The hostess  sat them and when she found out I was parking the car, she told them literally to \""GET UP.\""  She said they wouldn't seat them because I wasn't there.  By that time I had arrived at the table  my friends were still in shock by the utter rudeness.  Tessaro's was a Pittsburgh institution that my family had frequented for years.  Our treatment is a disgrace to its reputation"
-1,"I took my parents here because it's one of their favorite places, but I wasn't that impressed.  The service was impeccable, but the food - not much different than Outback or Texas Roadhouse."
-1,"Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.\n\nI had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \""difficult\"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \""Locks of Love,\"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.\n\nI watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \""wasn't looking right.\""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\n\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \""I have to leave, so sorry \""as I bolted for the door."
1,"No alterations! Nicht!\nI have out-of-town guests and always like them to experience the wonderful food and service at the Rokerij. I was craving my favorite Carne Adovada (pork roast dish), however I usually replace the rice and beans with some of their fresh seasonal vegetables. Not this time! Apparently the kitchen can't handle changing out sides (as of a couple months ago). So had to completely switch gears and figure out a new direction very quickly as rice & beans are not my friends. \nAs expected the meal was delightful but still craving my Carne!!"
1,My family loves coming to the Mesa Cracker's for breakfast and sitting on the patio (weather permitting of course)!  We always receive such wonderful service and food!
1,"Food and service is excellent! Salsa is fresh and delicious and the guac is equally delicious with a hint of jalape\u00f1o. They must've included a bit of jalapeno in the fajita veggies in my chicken quesadillla because my mouth was craving milk.  Our server brought my hubby a free fried ice cream since it was his birthday. :)  They also have gave me 2 free dinners for buying over $30 in gift certificates.  We loved Jessie, our server!  However, they don't have jalape\u00f1o cream cheese and the women's bathroom is old and little gross.  Just go to the bathroom elsewhere."
1,"My review is on the Sprouts Sandwich Counter only.\n\nI don't shop here or at any of the locations at this point because none are in walking distance of home. \n\nBut I was in with a friend and we grabbed SANDWICHES at the counter. They were made to order and they were good!  They were so fresh too! I had the Chicken salad on Multi-grain bread. Yummy, can't wait to stop in again for one.  And the full sandwich was $2.99 ( w/o cheese). \n\nMaybe I will shop here after all from time to time."
-1,Aaaaaa-hole employees give the worst service you'll ever have. Unless you're blackout go elsewhere. They wouldn't give me a water for a dollar. $1.08. Ate the pizza dry as shit. Never again. Pizza was good though.
1,"Man, I am going to miss Krua when I move back to Washington. I was pretty convinced the Southwest just didn't understand Thai food the way the West coast did, but I've been proven wrong. I'm updating my review because I finally got the chance to eat inside. I love the decor! It's just a small hidden place but it really is worth eating inside.\n\nI started with a water and a sweet Thai iced tea. I've never had anything like it! Super sweet and served with heavy cream on top. When stirred, the whole drink turns a bright orange. It was a really nice contrast to what we ordered..\n\nPineapple fried rice. Shrimp panang curry. Tofu pad thai. Veggie spring rolls. Get ready to say the Lord's name in vain, because that's all I can really do when I eat food from here. It's just great. I love the pad thai especially because it isn't overly greasy or soupy at all. The tofu was really good, pan-fried to perfection. And I like it hot! Even at a mere 'medium' spice it was burning my palate. The veggie rolls were meatless and were made with lots of pepper counteracted by the sweet and sour sauce. Steaming hot, extra-crisp. Great big portions make for plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nThe service is quick and the man who always seems to be working is so so friendly. We got pretty cold from a breeze coming in, and he even closed the door. \n\nI don't care what you Thai purists have to say... I get around when it comes to pad thai and this place is duking it out in my heart for first."
1,At AJ's you can buy fresh baked pizza. Try it. It's honestly one of best pizza's you will ever have. \nStaff is very nice. Overall great experience.
1,"Maybe it was just lucky timing, but I walked into Cigna Urgent care at 755 E McDowell and within FIVE minutes was brought back by a nurse for some screening.  Within ten minutes, i was seen by Dr. Michael Esmay.  Everyone had great customer service and generally positive attitudes.  I was very impressed and everyone was polite with great bedside manner."
-1,"Maybe I'm spoiled, but coming from Orlando to Charlotte, going to Carowinds was an eye-opener for me.  It made me remember just how much care is put into theme parks by Disney and Universal.   They don't put a lot of effort into theming, landscaping, or guest service at Carowinds, but they do throw some rides your way.  \n\nAs rides go, the rides are okay here at Carowinds, somewhere between a carnival and the theme parks in Orlando.  The old wooden Hurler roller coaster didn't make me want to hurl, but it did make me wish I was wearing a crash helmet.  My head felt like a martini -- shaken and stirred.  Some of the other rides felt like rides I used to go on as a kid; they haven't been updated.  \n\nAs for their food options, they're not great.  We waited awhile for below average theme park fare.  And don't even get me started with the guy who wanted to run off with our credit card to ask his manager something when we wanted to buy a soda.  That was 15 minutes of my life that I'd like back.  \n\nWhat does Carowinds have going for it?  Its proximity to Charlotte and an option for something to do for a day during the summer.  Other than that, save your money and go to Orlando."
-1,"I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.\n\nAfter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \""apologize\"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \""never salt his steak again\"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \n\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \n\nOverall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have."
1,"No Ka Oi (#1!) plate lunch in the desert!  Lived on fresh, inexpensive plate lunch when I lived on Oahu and the Big Island, and Moki's fits the bill.  I had the Ahi Plate lunch with white rice, and a spinach salad side.  The salad was non-traditional, but oh so good!  The fish rocked, and the rice had a nice touch of salt and sugar.  Very good.  Wife had the Kahlua Pork Plate Lunch, and that was equally good.  We live near San Tan Village, but will make the trip to Moki's regularly due to the quality, quantity, and authenticity.  I told you when I was there, and I'll say it again:  YOU GUYS ROCK!!  Aloha."
1,"Celebrity is one of the better concert venues in the valley.  Sometimes the stage revolves and other times they do a 3/4 house show and it doesn't.  Either way, good place to see a show.  The bar downstairs is decent, friendly bartenders.  Dodge is probably my favorite venue but for smaller or mid sized concerts/acts this is the place."
-1,"These people were so unbelievably rude to me. They were rude on the phone, they were rude when I picked my order up. I am not going back even though the food was good, not worth being treated like you are the smallest person in the world. There are a handful of other delis very very close that are just as good.\n\nUpdate: 11/22/14\nI just saw your truck driving down 7th Street in the most reckless dangerous way. Wow, if you're going to drive like a jerk, word of advice, don't vinyl wrap your truck with your business on it!"
1,"A friend of mine and I have been going here for lunch for a while. Our tradition would include escaping from school/work on Mondays and meeting up here for lunch. The coffee is good, the pastries are great, and the food is excellent. They used to have this iced tea there (but seemed to have swapped it for something else as of late) that was unbelievable. We called it the \""Tea of Freedom.\"" It tasted like a promising adventure awaiting you just around the corner. Stop laughing! It was really damn good iced tea. But just as it came into my life, it was gone just as elusively.\n\nThe owners are accommodating and charming. On slow days we would see him sitting outside with a demitasse of espresso and reading French newspaper, only to hop to his feet when we walked in. \n\nIt does appear the prices have gone up, and they're approaching steepness for a cafe, but this is the Biltmore after all. \n\nHighlight: Don't know what to get? Ask for a recommendation. You won't be sorry."
-1,"This place is awful.  The pizza is not good, but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad, they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it, I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone."
1,"Sundays couldn't be sweeter without a frequent stop here at Rokerij. From their \""Hip\"" staff to their decor; it entices you with each visit. Appetizers are a must and I highly recommend taking advantage of their Sunday Happy hour. You'll be strongly convinced."
-1,"Used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through Madison. We generally aim more for Country Inn or Hampton... but this was the best deal.  At check-in I was told they only had king beds left,  though the parking lot was quite empty.  When we got to the room there were no sheets for the hide-a-bed. We went to the front desk and asked for some. We were told that the security guard would bring them up. 45 minutes later (it was close to 12:30 am at this point) we had to call and remind them. \n\nThe room was pretty rough. Lots of ding marks on the doors and trims. The light over the mirror didn't work. Things were just worn out.  The bed had clearly seen better days.  Crowne gives you these silly \""relax packs\"" with aroma therapy stuff.  A good bed would do more for making me relaxed. \n\nIn general I wasn't impressed.  We'll stick with Country Inn & Hampton inns."
1,"I'm not sure where the negative reviews come from.  We've been coming here for years (probably 50-60 total meals) and I can only think of one or two experiences that were just mediocre and none that were bad.\n\nThis place amazes me, because it's one of the few buffet places where the food is actually consistently good and fresh.  Many of their dishes are always served, but they also do rotational dishes based around specific themes for limited times.  That keeps the menu from getting stale. \n\nThe salad bar is long enough for the 100 yard dash and the veggies and all the accompanying toppings are countless and plentiful in quantity.\n\nThe salad bar is just the starter.  They also have a hot food stations that serve rotating dishes of various pasta, sweet and baked potatoes, pizza, multiple breads and muffins, desserts, drinks, and a 6-7 choice soup bar that's outstanding!  Their soups are very good and made in-house.\n\nWhat I like best is the value.  You can find coupons for different deals, but we use the Family Meal Deal that feeds 2 adults and 2 kids for a flat $19.99 + drinks.  You can't find a better selection of healthy choices anywhere for less.\n\nIf you go to Sweet Tomatoes expecting a Michelin star dining experience, you will be disappointed.  If you expect lots of good, fresh dining options at a great price, you will be pleased with your choice to eat here.\n\nTIP: If you plan on visiting regularly, try to get the kids drink cups.  They offer free refills on future visits."
1,I love coming here for happy hour when I'm in town.  $5 glasses of wine between 11 am - 5 pm everyday.  Nice selection of reds/whites to choose from.  They also have delicious paninis and bruschetta.  Their desserts are also really yummy!  Everything is reasonably priced.  The outdoor patio makes the food and wine even more enjoyable.
1,"The best Italian sub I've had yet! The bread was so soft & fresh. The meat was extremely good. My husband's meatball sub looked amazing, he was going on about how good it was. Be prepared to get messy while eating here!"
1,I've been eating here for at least 15 years. And I must say its probably the only thai restaurant in the phoenix area that I will always return to. The food is tasty and consistent. I've tried many of the surrounding thai restaurants and most of them leave a lot to be desired. Thai Lana makes really good food. I recommend. Shrimp with chillis and mint I think is number 45 or 46 its tastey and I usually ask for one notch below thai hot so its hot but not so hot. Also I recommend the yellow or red curry. Coconut flavour and never watery just the rite amount coconut and spice. The portions are addiquete. I usually oder these two plates and invariably I always have some ledt over to take home.  A friend that is very much a steak and potatoes guy. He dosent care much at all for thai food. He really likes thai lana. In fact its been his suggestion that we dine here on our two most recent visits. The ony con I can think of is that they don't have brown rice. If they had brown rice I would give them 5 stars
-1,"This is my second time coming to this location in a month. Its right there w/ where I regularly get gas during lunch. You would think that w/ it being right next to Carowinds and its the summertime that it would be faster during lunch time . \n\nToday's visit was not any different. They only had one person taking orders at 12:30 and the drive thru had like 4 cats waiting for orders to be taken. Workers behind the counter didn't know what people ordered so they were confused. \n\nIf this place wasn't connected to the gas station I like to use, I would go across the street to Subway or drive 5 min more to the McDs when I want a burger.  I mean prime location and they're taking advantage of people they know will come here because of their location."
-1,"Armadillo grill is usually a place my\nCoworkers and I like to out out together after work. The spinach dip is great and the servers are nice. Recently, I tried joining them at the bar and had the worst experience, I will not be going back. The bartender was very rude to me and after six times of asking for a menu I had to flag down a server to get any help. It took 2 hours to get an order of wings and I was very unhappy with the service. Armadillo is great if you go during happy our and sit at a table, but I would never recommend going to the bar."
1,"Very solid little Northern Italian restaurant on the outskirts of PV. Friendly, efficient servers, great entrees. My only problem was the appetizer mussels were tiny, but the other app (a grilled veggie platter) and all the entrees were great. A solid 4 stars....."
-1,"Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my \""plastic money\"" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???  \n\nThe customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. \n\nNeedless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores..."
1,Got chicken chimi ... so good.. so much food. Have come here multiple times . Everything is always great.  Family owned and operated.  Great people.
-1,Avoid avoid avoid. What is this place Japanese? Italian? Do they know who they are? We ordered seaweed salad - I think my frys has better salad for $2; my daughter ordered California rolls - very average; the pad Thai was as bland as I have ever had and the calamari was over fried and zero flavor - no wonder they offer  sauce. Kids liked the cinnamon flavored bread so that accounts for one star.
-1,"There's a reason why this place has no reviews.  It's never open...not even at 6:30 pm on a Thursday.  Even though the sign said \""Open\"" and the door was open.  I guess I was supposed to know that it was closed.  But all I got was two people screaming in my ear that it was closed like I barely understood or something.  So much for customer service.  Needless to say, I probably won't be back."
1,"Unlike most eateries in Phoenix where often I take on a \""willfully blind\"" approach to service/ambiance,etc, I actually felt as though I was not in Phoenix the moment I arrived in this dark toned jewel of a restaurant.  Simply put, the dining experience exceeded any expectations I had for the evening.  Gorgeous stemware perfectly complimented a very understated and meticulously considered wine list.  Upon the arrival of my main course, I suffered through slobber fits while awaiting the rest of the tables food (momentary wait).  The Surf n Turf (dungeness crab enchiladas, bacon wrapped jumbo prawns, delicious mashed potatoes, and perfectly cooked piece of beef - $29) - was served on girthy plates framed by an artfully presented dish.  Healthy portions, overflowing flavor and subtly attentive service catapulted the Rokerij to the top of my Valley favorites.  If a single dining experience could suggest of more delectably similar experiences to come, this was it!  Every meal at the table was equally as well received as mine and I don't think you'll find a better salad than the Rokerij concoction we partook in prior to the main course...simply put, a superlative dining experience from start to finish!  \n\nI can't wait to return for their \""small plate\"" and $7 glass of wine happy hour."
1,"Had a blast at this spot ( and not just because i whooped my b/f's ass either on the track..bhahaha)\n\nanywho, we signed up and became members cheaper to do it that way if you think you will get the urge to race often. Member is $14 and some change and non member is $20. You sign up, pick a racing name that will permanently been yours forever and eva.. ( Sexyspeeder, right here :) ) you get a head sock you will have to wear under the Helmet, free t-shirt if you sign up also.  LADIES wear closed toe shoes... i had to borrow some of there's and lets just say i never want to wear rental shoes again.\n\nYou can race as much as you want, take breaks in between or do back to back if you choose. On Sundays they combine the tracks together so its an even longer track. it was really fun, those little karts go pretty fast ( and they do take bumping very seriously..they will pull your grown ass over and scold you like a little kid if they catch you..i know cause they gave my b/f a talkin too) they keep track of your best lap and which place you came in and you get a paper that records all this... my #1 is plastered on the refrigerator! whoop whoop.\n\nIf your looking for some competitive fun, try this place out. They also have food, drinks, rock wall, and arcade also. \n\nAlso might be a cool spot to throw a kids b-day party also!\n\nvroom-vroom!"
-1,"The only reason I've ever been to this hell hole is because I knew someone who worked there. You can see overweight sorority girls clumsily swinging around the \""poles\"" in the back bar while attempting to get the attention of one of the bartenders and dodge the puke on the floor.\n\nOne good thing is that the drinks are RIDICULOUSLY cheap. shots are $2, pitchers can be as low as $4. I would imagine that if you went there in the afternoon you could have an enjoyable happy hour on the patio, but don't go anywhere near this place after 10."
-1,"Service was horrible from the start. We waited for an eternity just to get menus. There was even a wait after I personally had to ask them to bring us menus. The waitress said they are very busy but the place was at 40% capacity. I understand if things are going slow but the amount of time before we even got our menus was a little ridiculous.\n\nSecond biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time. We had a party of 6 and 4 menus came out, before the next 2. Only 4 waters came out, before the best 2. All of our burgers came out at different times. Also, between each visit from our waitress, there is a long wait.\n\nNow the food. I got the California burger with onions rings. The burger was extremely bland, you hardly notice there is guacamole, bacon or basically anything. I'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty. Only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings. Today they had half off burgers, which is the only reason why anyone should try their burgers. At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.\n\nIt's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...\n\nIf you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday. I'm thoroughly disappointed."
-1,I've only been here twice. It's a very cheap place to have a drink. Which is good.\n\nThey must not make enough money to run the A/C because it is so hot in there and they have a big fan running instead. \n\nThe pizza I had didn't impress me. It tastes like cheese substitute that comes from a bag. \n\nThe bar is very dated and not in a charming divey way but in an economically depressed way. The bar feels dirty and I imagine it looks worse with bright lights. Good thing it's dark.\n\nI never come here and I won't likely be a regular.
-1,"Boy, I don't know.  I went alone at around 3:00 in the afternoon on a Wednesday.  I was famished and didn't want to search the area for a place to grab a bite so I gave the place a try.\nI ordered the chicken pad tai - thinking it would be a safe bet.  Honestly, it tasted like the cook was trying to get rid of some leftover food from the lunch hour.  I did like the crunchy bean sprouts - the only thing that gave the dish any texture at all.  Mixed in were the asian style noodles I expected and also spagetti.  They were both like mush from overcooking.  Though I ordered chicken, I found very little but there was loads of tofu in the dish which I wasn't expecting.  Also - the food was very bland.  Not a hint of kick to it at all.  I may have just come at a bad time, but I don't think I'll go back."
1,Awesome pizza! Music was so cool too! Great for all ages! He accepts requests to plus birthday announcements!  Accepts only $ or checks!
-1,"This place just bored me.\nReally don't know what to say.\nBored, bored, bored, bored, bored."
1,"Winner.\n\nYou want healthy?  You got it.\nYou want vegetarian/vegan?  You got it.\nYou want your food to taste amazing?  You got it.\nService?  You guessed it.\n\nA spicy cha cha might sound like something you might want to avoid, but don't look over this menu item at Loving Hut.  I don't even remember what was in it, and frankly I don't care... it was simply amazing.\n\nStart with a variety of the spring/summer/egg rolls and get a few different dishes, because you're going to want to try as many as possible.\n\nNext time I will definitely start with dessert.  I could see how you'd always end up too full after dinner, but they look too amazing to miss."
-1,"Ok, so most of what people are saying about Buffalo Exchange is true. They don't buy what you think they should buy, they look like they think they are better than you, and no their store isn't amazing. But you need to be honest and look at what is really going on. First, it is a thrift store, they aren't going to pay you what you paid for the item. Second, they are buying what they think their customers will buy (really it is what THEY like and would buy so look at who is sorting your stuff). Third, they work at...Buffalo Exchange...that is their level, so the little bit of power to either accept or reject you IS their big moment and they take is seriously.\n\nWalk in there expecting your \""rags\"" to be rejected and when one gets accepted be excited for your $5. I watched who shopped there, it was NOT cool, young, hip, or thin people. And I watched them sort through bags of middle aged women's clothing and buy some stuff I would never wear. Then I watched them reject True Religion jeans and some very expensive career pants. They won't wear that and they feel their customers won't either. It isn't personal, at least for you it shouldn't be, they aren't rejecting you, just your cool, expensive, designer clothes."
-1,"Phoenix Zoo employee Brandon (white male in his 20s). who was working the front gate called me a Dick. \n\nYou are not gonna believe this, I'm still in shock. Worst interaction with any employee ever. \nMy mother was visiting here from out of town and we decided to take my 2 1/2 year old my mom and myself to the Phoenix Zoo today.\nWe got there at noon and purchase the Wild Ride bands.  We spent all day at the zoo and were exhausted at the end of the day. It was 5PM and the zoo was closing so we were making our way to the exit. I had my 2 1/2 yr old daughter in a wagon and had pulled her around the zoo, I've been to the zoo several times and know that they want most traffic to exit through the gift shop but I didn't want to lug around my wagon into the gift shop, instead I preferred to exit through the entrance so I made my way towards the entrance to exit.  There was one young guy standing right in the middle of the gates and he said to me are you looking for the exit and I said well I want to exit here instead of going through the gift shop because I don't want to roll this wagon through there and he responded sorry you have to this is not an exit. I wasn't turning around though so I kept walking toward the left side of the gate, he was still standing in the middle of the section and said you can't exit here and I said, well listen this gate here opens can you just open it? (I waited for him to come over and offer to help but he stood fast where he was and said no)\nWhen I realized he wasn't going to accommodate I started to work the latch and I said it opens this way right (pulling instead if pushing)? he says No, then I pushed and it opened and he said it opens that way.\n(At this point I wasn't mad, just wanted to leave). As I opened the gate and rolled through I said I am not going through the gift shop with my daughter and this wagon, when you have kids you'll understand, to which he replied; \""maybe you should learn how to say no.\"" I stopped in my tracks and turned to him (still leaning against the turn style) and I said \""Maybe you should mind your own business.\"" Then I turned around again and heard; \""maybe you shouldn't be such a Dick.\"" WOW I was really speechless that an employee would say something like that in front of my child!!!! Of course physical contact is out of the question so I said \""do you like working here because today's your last day buddy.\""\nHe looked and rolled his eyes, I said get your manager out here right now and he said \""No.\"" So I noticed his radio was sitting on the gate right in front if him so I walked up to grab it and he said oh no and took it. I turned around looking for someone and no one was there so I started to call the zoo on my cell phone and just then an employee was walking in the office and I waved her down from the outside she came out and I explained what just happened and the she said OK hold on and went back in to return moments later with a supervisor, I didn't catch her name but she came out and shook my hand and introduced herself. \nI explained what just happened and she looked at the employee and waited for his response.  He said I walked up and asked for him to open the gate and then I just opened the gate and walked out. He totally denied everything after that and didn't admit anything! Crazy right?!\nI've gotta say in hindsight this supervisor didn't handle this effectively. The first thing she started to explain to me was their gate/exit policy saying how they do ask all guests to exit thru the gift shop and that the only reason the entrance gate is open is because of the fire code...I kind of interrupted her and said \""you don't have to explain that to me...\"" Then just asked what's your policy if a guest insists on exiting here are you required to allow it and she said yes. OK then that's end of story this guy did nothing and was very inappropriate and she said \""well this is a he said she said and we will have a talk with him. \""\nWhen I got home I told my wife what happened and she was furious, she said you paid to have a good experience there and an employer was not only rude to you for no reason but used bad language in front of your child and no one apologized to you or offered you anything. What kind of experience is that???\nSo I decided that first I need to notate what happened so I don't forget, second I am going to place a call tomorrow to the park manager and discuss what took place.\nI was real exhausted today and just wanted to leave and didn't take the time to think about how I should of handled this.\n\nUpdate to this review:\nI called the Zoo Tuesday morning and left a message for Jennifer which is Janelles supervisor but she never called me back, so I called the zoo Wed and asked for Jannelles boss Bonnie and left her a msg in the AM and no one called back. If I hear something I will update this review."
-1,"So dirty!!! Hair in our food three visits in a row and everything you order is saturated and butter or oil. No thank you! Especially not with Snooze, Luci's  and Daily Dose so close. Time to revamp!!"
-1,"Oh how sad. \n\nFull of younger kids who don't really know that gay doesn't need to be synonymous with slutty or bitchy. \n\nBig dance floor area, and a bar quartered off by a chain link fence (for real). Sigh. \n\nKind of what you don't want a gay bar to be."
1,"The food was really really good and the prices were very reasonable so a definite 2 thumbs up for me.  We had the Chicken Soulveka (?spelling), the Mandarin Chicken Salad, and the pita chips.  Everything tasted really fresh.  But the best thing was the Pita Pizza because our 7 year old and 5 year old both loved it.   The reason we gave them 5 stars was that the staff was really nice and made great suggestions.  The location is great because it's right next to Harkins Theatres; we just found out that they have a Dinner and a Movie promotion.  We'll definitely be back !  NOTE: I just read the 1 star comments and I believe that they are under new management so give them a try."
-1,"My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. \n\nOnce we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. \n\nOh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience."
1,i have to change my review after talking to bobby the general manager he turned me over to Vince who went out of his way to make us happy. Very pleased
-1,"I was in the market for a black floral embossed belt (no giant buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly support a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).\n\nI walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more \""attention grabbing\"" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).\n\nI don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no."
-1,"Tom's Diner is one of those places I really, really want to like. You see it when driving down the street and it looks like a cool, retro place that got picked up from the past and dropped in the present next to the chain stores and abandoned buildings lining the rest of the street. If only the experience here matched the charming exterior.\n\nI don't have a problem with the diner food, first of all; it's not great, but hey, for cheap eats, it's not bad. They make a mean French onion soup, I admit. \n\nMy problem is more with the maintenance of the place. The windows are dirty, seats are busted, tables aren't properly cleaned - those things really detract from the experience and make the place look run-down and a bit unwelcoming.\n\nThe biggest offense for me, though? The service. My waitress? It took her three trips to remember I had ordered an additional drink (yes, we reminded her), by which time I was almost done with my meal. Also: this diner does not have ketchup at its tables. This would be okay if the servers remembered to bring it out with all meals. They do not. \n\nSeriously, guys: you operate in Pittsburgh. Ketchup is mandatory.\n\nI may poke in for a quick bite again, but I'll be honest with my final opinion: considering how mediocre my experience was on a slow Saturday night, I suspect some fast food chains could knock Tom's out of the park on a busy day at this diner."
-1,"I gave Moto a few tries because it was the closest sushi place to where I was living (would get it for take out).  Each time I was mildly disappointed....sushi is medicore, nothing really stood out to me.  Their salmon sashimi is smoked, wierd in my opinion being a sashimi lover.  Wish I could them better, but not impressed."
-1,"This place has a variety of exotic drinks and chocolates but it is kinda pricey. I could have gotten better chocolates at that price elsewhere because theirs taste like Hershey's. The drinks are worth trying but it is not great. I love that they have a nice view from the second storey especially but they DO NOT offer free wi-fi. So, I can't study or do research while in there."
1,"Oddly enough I only came to this location after visiting the new Gilbert location. Have to say I think I like the Gilbert locale better and I'm almost a little sick hearing myself say that. Not sure what was up with the rap music on this visit as I am in love with the music at the other locations. Not a great fan of the valet either as they don't seem to know how to dive manual cars or operate emergency  brakes. \n\nSo, I'm giving this location 4 stars based on the whole concept and the food (and assuming it will be better next time) but in my heart it gets 3 stars."
-1,Too expensive for what it is.  I had the ham and cheese flat this morning and it was the worst breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my whole entire life!!!  The ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese. I will certainly never go back for a breakfast sandwich.
1,Quaint place close to downtown. After touring the heard museum we headed over here in search of authentic mexican food. The food was indeed delicious! They also had a selection of home made cookies and rolls and things like that in the 'bakery' section. My friend was absolutely in love with their salsa which you can buy in an 8 oz. portion for I believe 3 or 4.99 or something like that. I was a little concerned when the person ordering in front of us had their order taken completely in spanish. I have zero language skills other than english but was pleasantly surprised when it came our turn and the girl took our order in 100% fluent enlish. Would go here again if I was ever in the area.
-1,"We recently went to Clyde's Hardware for a replacement part for a bidet.  Salesman was helpful but had to order the part which he did on the computer or so we thought.  Told us the part was in stock, took our credit card payment and told us a day when the part would be there.  But they NEVER ordered the part!!  When I inquired, Debbie was curt to say the least.  Later called me and told me the part \""was on back order!\""  Not so according to the salesman.\n\nWhy oh why would we want to do business with them in the future?  We were required to pay shipping ($13.00 for a plastic part that weighed no more than 1/2 ounce) plus tax, plus made several trips to the store and to be treated like that??  No wonder amazon and other competitors are cleaning their clocks and they have a sign on their door not allowing photos."
-1,"I've been here quite a few times, and I always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near Pitt. They have a ton of nice HDTVs.\n\nEverytime I go, there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that I get. I was just there for the Pitt/Oakland game and got a Redhook. I drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\n\nThe food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. I've had the pork nachos and they were blah."
1,"I'm usually not a huge fan of airports because they are usually always a cluster-F...but something about this one makes going here less stressful.  Getting here is kind of goofy, especially if you are returning a rental car, but once you are here it is pretty easy to get in, get through security, and get to your gate.  There's a nice Starbucks before going through security and some cool Arizona touristy-type shops.  Once through security, which is usually painless, there's some fast food restaurants and a nice Mexican restaurant/bar right by the Delta terminals to help make the ride a little more enjoyable.  Not a bad airport!"
1,"When you need crickets for your gecko and it's getting late, and the poor thing has to eat, you can jump in here to grab a dozen or so and get on your way with medium speed.\n\nSometimes you gotta wait just a bit for the staff to help you out (it seems that most pet stores these days are a little understaffed if you get more than a couple of customers in there), but that's only a mild inconvenience when you're shopping for your beloved cricketeater.\n\nHaven't used them for anything else than that--but most Petsmarts have the same thing this one does--dog food, cat food, birds, reptiles, and all the stuff you'll need to keep them properly fed, housed, clean, and even dressed."
-1,"well, I have never done business with these folks, but I did see someone driving down I17 in a gray Toyota pickup with big yellow TITLES R US signs throwing his trash out of the window. I suppose I would avoid doing that if I was representing my company that way.\nWhen I need DMV service, I will avoid them."
1,"Just came here today for a corporate event. What a neat experience! This was my first time and what a phenomenal place for my first High Tea experience. The tea sommelier was very experienced and our \""server\"" (not sure that's what they are called during High Tea) was charming! Great for Mother's Day or momma-type event. What a treat!"
-1,"Just found hair in the pizza. Eww! Never again from this location will I order food, blah!"
1,"Fun place with lots to do: train ride, mine tour, etc.  The prices are a little high for the experience.  Best part: Mystery Shack. A total must visit!"
1,"Yes...I admit it...I've a soft spot for southern food. CBs were reminiscent of the food I grew up with in childhood. Although not authentic in all flavors (to my memory), it certainly hit close to home anytime I was on the road. I was saddened to learn that there was nothing closer than AZ or Sacramento....\n\nOn a day of a craving, I hopped in the car, drove to this location and ordered my tradition: country fried steak, fried okra, biscuits, steak fries, mashed potatoes, and crumble for dessert. Service was good (consistent with the fellow CBs I've been to across the country) and food hit the spot."
-1,"The body worlds exhibit was great if you can get thru it in 1-1/2 hrs. Forget any appointments after 3pm--you will be rushed and not worth your money. Don't purchase the $5 audio phone unless you have 5 hrs to spend there, the dialogue is informative but much too long to accomodate time limits. I am sure this is because the science center wants you to come back 2-3 more times to listen to it all--NOT GONNA HAPPEN! We are members and don't appreciate being pushed to come back 3 times to see the entire exhibit, leave the center open until everyone has finished if you are going to schedule late appts like this\n\nNot happy at all"
1,"I love Chipotle. This location, though not as good as the one on Camelback, for whatever reason, is still great.\nThe food always tastes fresh and the ingredients are the above standard. The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic.\nChipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic. \nAlthough the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil.\nNo matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly.\nIt is refreshing to have a business that actually cares and at the same time serve an amazing product."
1,"When I was in town and wanted to treat a friend to a Mexican dinner (a cheap dinner as I'm not currently flush with cash), my mom suggested El Bravo.  She knows me well - I like clean tasty Mexican dives and this was perfect. Note that when I say dive, I still want to eat on a real plate and sit at a booth with a modicum of cushioning. \n\nWhen you walk into El Bravo, don't be fooled by the window you see and the line of people standing there. (I was - until a nice woman standing in line told me there's table service.) Those people like the place so much they're picking up tortillas and meals to go. \n\nThe food was tasty and cheap. A winning combination in my book! The chips were thin and crispy with just the right amount of salt.  The salsa was chunky and fresh-tasting.  They're definitely not opening up jars of Pace in the back.  We both ordered the chili relleno dinners.  My friend loved the rice.  I thought it was fine but he really liked it.  So you might really like it too.  The beans were creamy with the requisite melted cheese on top.  I like my chili rellenos a bit plumper with more egg coating but the benefit of the size of these rellenos is you could finish your whole meal and not feel like a total pig.  \n\nWhen you pay, you look directly into the kitchen and they run a clean, tight ship there.  \n\nAll in all, a great place to grab two dinners with chips/salsa and one soda for $25 and change.  ($21 something for dinner plus $4 tip)"
-1,"I went to I Do I Do because it was right down the street from my house. I had already purchased my wedding gown but still needed Bridesmaid dresses and Tuxes for the guys.\n\nOur original sales girl was great and very helpful. I had 9 girls in my party so dress shopping was a bit hecktic. I took 4 with me the first time, 2 had to make their own appointments and then I took the last 3 in...so I tried to make it as easy as possible. The store hours they keep are almost next to impossible to shop around, because twice they told me they didnt ALLOW bridesmaid dress shopping on satrudays...What business doesnt let customers come in to shop and GIVE THEM MONEY? Thats where all of our issues started\n\nThe assistant Mgr was the nasty girl ever. She made my bridesmaids feel unwelcome and she was very rude to me. The owner of the shop finally stepped in adn after that it was smooth sailing. \n\nDO NOT use the alterations person they recomend that is next door to them, they botched one of te girls dresses so badly it was almost unwearable! \n\nWe did get the guys tuxes through I do I do which carries the Jims Formalwear Line. The guys tuxes looked soooo good! We had only a slight issue with one of them not fitting and it was fixed asap! \n\nThey do have a good selection. They just need better staffing."
1,I have been coming here for many many years. The food is always excellent and fresh very authentic cajun. They have 1 of the best crawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e that I have ever had including in the new orleans. Friendly's helpful stuff is there to make your meal perfect. Great jumbalaya dirty rice and there garlic bread.
1,My husband and I are fans of the cacti and so we planned a visit to the Desert Botanical Gardens on a recent house hunting trip to AZ. The day we went it was close to 100 and so we were happy that there are so many water fountains sprinkled around the gardens. We stayed for about two hours enjoying all the beautiful displays. The gardens are set up so that one can enjoy many different environments. There a also a lot of shady spots with seating to rest and enjoy the surroundings. We will definitely be back soon!
1,I will miss you.
1,"I have only been here for Happy Hours - so this is only a review for HH offierings and experiences.\n\nTwo visits - the first was a party of five, the second a party of six.\n\nSince Embassy provides Happy Hour for guests of the hotel (in another location, I am guessing), there was almost no one in the lobby bar, which is also the bar for Omaha Steakshouse.\n\nDrinks:  I ordered a whiskey and coke ($5.00 well drinks), and the bartender asked if I'd prefer ginger ale.  While I adore a good whiskey and ginger, most bars don't have REAL ginger ale - so I rarely order it.  As a bartender, I know I only make suggestions to change a customers order if we are out of the requested item or if I feel it will make the drink that much better.  I didn't imagine they could be out of Coke - so I am guessing it was a suggestion for improvement and I agreed to it.  GOOD CALL!  Not only was real ginger ale used - the angel behind the bar muddled in some fresh ginger for me, too!  YUM!\nMy companions had assortments of house wines, margaritas and beer.  Everyone was happy.\nThe food offerings are all appetizer sized and perfect for sharing.  And, only $5.00 during Happy Hour!\nThe wings are wings - nothing disappointing, but nothing to write home about.\nThe Buffalo Chicken Sliders were tasty - but the bread was really the standout part of this dish, and I did appreciate the large chunks of bleu cheese in the dressing.\nThe Hamburger Sliders are wonderful!  You can tell they are fresh grinding the meat from the quality beef they use.  The onions are sauteed to perfection and the buns are fresh, warm and the perfect golden brown.  Three to a plate - we had to order a second round of these!\nPulled pork sliders were unremarkable, but okay.  (Like the wings.)  There was nothing wrong with them - and at $5 for three sliders, I have no right to expect an epiphany.\nI can't do our last dish justice.  It's homemade potato chip \""nachos\"" with a bleu cheese sauce.  Honestly, despite having shared two orders of these on my first visit and one the second, I don't remember what else is on them but WOW - this is comfort food at its best and I can't wait to go back for more!\n\nThe room is not a typical hotel lobby.  There is a huge koi pond running throughout the lobby, and tall tropical trees.  I felt as if I was in a far cooler and more tropical area  - it was easy to forget I was in mid town Phoenix.\n\nIt seems this happy hour is still unknown - very few other people there for either visit.  But - I happen to adore the lack of loud music and ability to get top notch service - so that's not a complaint from me!\n\nIf they stretch happy hour to 7 instead of 6, I will gladly add on that elusive 5th star!"
1,"Well, this is the third motel I've stayed in in 4 nights and the first one that I had no problems with--clean room i stayed in for two nights, friendly helpful clerks and convenient location.  It didn't smell like smoke either!  I had a handicapped room both nights and liked the nice big bathroom!  Yay!"
1,"It's a chain, and it's not that close to Glendale.\n\nNot at all what I wanted, nor did I speak up when when Capital Grille was suggested.\n\nI'm a \""go with the flow\"" kind of guy and since we were grabbing cabs I knew in an instant that a gin drink was in my near future.\n\nThere are Capital Grilles everywhere. LIKE I MEAN EVERYWHERE!\n\nNew York, DC, Denver you name it. But my friends love it. Why? Because it isn't Ruth Chris.\n\nIs Ruth Chris a suckfest? No, not ever. But Capital Grille has a way of making each of it's locations a little more unique.\n\nThis one has the most uniqueness than ever.\n\nExcellent attentive service. Ketchup with your steak? Sure, they won't judge. Lobster mac n cheese with chunks of lobster you can actually see (without the aid of a microscope), umm yeah and it's good.\n\nGin martini's? Oh Boy.\n\nI bookmarked a local spot, but ok I walked away feeling like steak greatness was found."
1,Always good and dependable food and service
-1,"Place is awesome, Bartenders real nice. DJ's suck. We have patronized all the goth  bars in town for years and DJ's are getting so bad with music. I used to love this place, now I don't think we will ever go back.... shame too, because all other bars/clubs are closed down. We need a better scene and better DJ's!"
-1,"No way, dudes. Go down the street and get some tastier food at Tram's Kitchen. The grub is better, the restaurant itself is a little cleaner (not saying much on either account), and the water even tastes better. \n\nReally. I'm not joking about the water."
-1,"This store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures. We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked, and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone. The salesclerk told us that was not allowed. We were dumbfounded. We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, \""I don't know-- they just don't allow it.\"" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)\n\nWe tried to press further, though-- what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures? The salesclerk said, \""Oh, people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works.\"" I'm sorry, but unless you're omniscient, this is not acceptable. \n\nThe most insulting thing, though, is the clerk telling us \""I don't know\"" about a policy that's so clearly the exception to the local norm. If you're going to have a ridiculous, anachronistic rule, at least have the guts to explain why to customers when they ask."
-1,"I don't think there's much to Zen 32 besides looking trendy.\n\nSomething seemed strange about the place when I walked in, and after reading other reviews it's been pointed out--the waitresses are wearing Chinese attire with Mandarin collars. I won't hold the lack of authenticity against them. Also, the music is soft and the seating kind of cramped, making for an awkward dining experience.\n\nI'll get the good thing out of the way--the reverse happy hour. The hot ginger sake was overpowering, but for $1 there's no way I can complain. Also, they had a few basic rolls for $3, and that's not too bad. \n\nEverything else sucks! The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab, so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi? My tootsie roll was garbage, I couldn't taste anything beside the krab inside. The caterpillar roll looked nice, but I could only taste krab and eel sauce. Even the rainbow roll looked promising, and THAT was drenched in sriracha. \n\nI also had some of this teriyaki chicken entree, and it was rough and a bit dry. The edamame had way too much salt, and I began noticing a pattern to this place. Take crap and season it as much as you can.\n\nI'd like to give this place a second chance for a cheap date or something, but I'm still a little angry at this place (and their sketchy waitress!), for being the first to make me tired of sushi. A friend bought me this meal and I still regret it. It's that bad."
1,Freshly-made pasta is delicious!
1,This place is awesome!  Service and food is great!!
1,Yay!!!! I've finally found a decent Vietnamese restaurant in North Scottsdale.  I had the PHO (customized the way I like it) and a sandwich.  Both were really good!  Very reasonably price and the service couldn't be faster.  I just wish they had a bigger menu but they have the basics so I will be back for sure!
-1,"No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile. \nA coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did.\nHowever, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.\n\nYes, mold.\n\nSorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.\n\nWho knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.\n\n*ETA\nMM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive."
-1,"I have visited Harper's a few times in the past two years. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The atmosphere is warm and personable, which is nice for couples and families.\n\nBut with each experience, I am less impressed. The food is good. However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.\n\nI am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /"
-1,"1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!\n2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.\n3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!\n Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!"
1,"I love this place. They have such great food, i leave satisfied every visit.\nThe foods delish, the staff is friendly, and the decor is awesome. \nCould eat there everyday  :)"
-1,"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. That is exactly where I am at with the beloved Swizzle Inn. But only with a certain semi-tall blonde (brunette w/highlights) bartender who apparently refuses to acknowledge me hanging over the bar with empty drink in hand as she prepares drinks for everybody else that walks up after me. Not on one occasion...three. Now, since I'm one to give the benefit of the doubt I can afford to give her some leeway. Here it is: 1) She is inept at her job who folds at the first sign of decent business and is unable to differentiate who was waiting first. 2) She would rather I be a six foot blonde chic who has the hots for her. 3) She is a racist that would prefer to snub me albeit I have a history of tipping well. 4) Number one and three. 5) Number two and three. 6) All of the above. 7) She can't handle the pressure of working at a small neighbor bar solo. \n\nWhatever the answer is, it's ashame because I'm all for the neighborhood bar. \n\nMy last attempt was to purchase a $50 gift certificate for a friend who loves the place. I'm actually glad this chic saved me $50 by acting like a flustered nincompoop. \n\nAlright, I'm done. This place is too cool to totally abandon but I'm not giving this particular \""woman\""any more of my money.\n\nThanks for reading."
1,"We've been on the lookout for inexpensive and tasty Chinese food. We're done looking! This place isn't fancy, but our take-out was delish! The pork egg foo young was super, and the honey garlic chicken was perfect. Crispy chicken with the right amount of sauce. The people running the place were very friendly, and the food was ready very quickly. And they deliver... We'll probably do delivery next time."
1,"The company did a nice job installing my fence and it looks good.  I especially appreciated Andrew's attention to detail when it came to preparing the bid, measurements, and explaining to me the variations in materials and the entire process.  I also appreciate that he was conscious of my budget and worked with me on that.  The company would have gotten five stars, but the install was a day later than what they agreed to."
-1,"The RAMEN is excellent.  The owners are sweet and the ambiance is pleasant.\n\nI gave it a low rating for the customer service. My first visit I was seated in the back and had to wait for service a lot, for long periods of time.  I didn't mind due to the gracious hospitality\n\nMy second visit, was terrible. They saw me walk in and didn't offer me a menu or greet me. A second customer walked in after me and they helped that person first, instead of me.\n\nFinally someone asked if I had a question. I said no, I'm waiting for a menu. He turned to the hostess and said \""oh, why did you tell me she had a question?\"" and then he just walked away leaving me to wait longer. \n\nWhen I finally got a waiter, I already knew what I wanted, I didn't waste the waiters time. I waited a LONG for my food until I ran out of time to eat it. THE WAITER DIDN'T CHECK ON ME AGAIN UNTIL I STOOD UP TO LEAVE. He had the nerve to ask if I needed anything. I told him I ran out of time to eat and had to leave. He didn't apologize, he just put the check on the table and left again. \n\nI do not know if this is a place where you have to wait for them to come grab the check or if you are supposed to take it up to the hostess but he never came back so I took it up to the hostess. She just stood there, IN FRONT OF ME, drying wet cups.\n\nI was just there for a lunch break soup. Why did it take an hour?"
-1,"My experience was on a random Saturday afternoon, and I think that might skew my opinion a bit.\n\nDuring my visit we were the only guests dining.  There was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees.  \n\nThe atmosphere is mellow.  And I can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings.\n\nThe prices were a bit high for what we ate.  I had a pita sandwich and it was just under $10.  The lunch prices are a bit steep.\n\nThe food was okay, but nothing I'd go back time and time again for."
-1,"Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.\n\nI'm not sure if Palazzo is always open \""sometimes\"" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. \n\nEvery time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. \n\nAlso? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks."
-1,"The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat \""chicken\"" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.\n\nI was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.\n\nThe service was friendly enough, though. \n\nNot to be recommended unless you're desperate."
-1,I brought my boots here to get fixed. They did a good job however the lady was extremely rude when I came to pick them up. I won't be going here again.
1,"The food was fine on my only visit to Blue Fin, when my son and I stopped in on a hot, off peak summer afternoon following a library assignment., but what  we remember most was the elderly Japanese lady who refilled our drinks, took several moments to chat, and repeatedly referred to my son as \""Son\"". Or possibly \""San\"" - I'm not entirely sure. \n\nShe just had a gentle grace about her, from another culture, and another era, that made a lasting impression on my teenager. That was three or four months ago, and he still brings her up every so often. \n\n\""Hey Dad. Remember that lady at Blue Fin?\""\n\n\""What's that?\""\n\nOh, who am I kidding.  She made an impression on me too."
1,Above average for airport food.   The service was friendly and the food was fresh.   The eating area needed a good cleaning.    A free to cookie to finish off the meal......better then expected.
1,"Great trails... A lot of bikers...  I have been running on south mountain now for years.  I like the part of south mountain that is in Ahwatukee.  I usually park by warpaint and then run from warpaint all the way down desert classic.  The trail is clean and offers trails that are easier and more challenging.  It's very peaceful and you can get lost (in a good way).  The only downfall, it is very rocky, so when you're running, watch out for rocks or else you'll have an accident like I did last week!  Try out south mountain, you will enjoy all of the hiking and nature and it's close to everything in the valley."
-1,"Rocking chairs don't mean much to the road weary traveler who has already been on the road, either on a plane or stuck in an airport for well over 12 hours; especially when said traveler realizes she is stuck in Charlotte overnight, and not in Nashville, where she was headed and has a reservation at a nice comfy hotel and dinner reservations somewhere yummy.  Add to this the fact that the place is a damned ghost town late at night and if you're really super lucky you just might get to wander the length of three entire concourses looking for someone who can help you, rushing with your heavy ass computer bag, because maybe, just MAYBE there is another flight?!  But there isn't, and the empty empty airport mocks you for being so foolishly optimistic.  And then you can go and stay at the Ramada for $59.  Only if you're lucky though.\nBetter signage would be nice Charlotte-Douglas, and white rockers don't quite make up for it.  Especially since you're a US Airways hub and I needed to find some US Airways help, which my ticket printout helpfully mentions I can find in any concourse, which is an absolute lie.\nWhite rockers and wi-fi are nice, but not that nice."
1,".  Angel, daughter of the Lounge's owner Joy is a HOOT!!  I love her personality.  It's not a fancy place, little hole in the wall type place. They have been open for 8 years and have had a pretty steady following.  There is art on the walls (LOVE the Dizzie Gillespie painting... thinking of buying it) painted by a local artist.  Live music on Wednesdays/Fridays.  Wednesdays step classes (the Al B. look alike) and they have another separate dining-type area.  Wednesday nights they hold something called a conversation party.  Random 5 topics are chosen (we had a peek at last night's conversations) EX:  Are momma's boys a good or bad thing?   What makes a partner in a relationship think they need to start playing games?  What is most important to you in your professional career?\n\nApparently some of these discussions, as you can imagine - adding the alcohol ingredient - can get pretty heated.  It seemed to be a big group last night... 15-20 people.  \n\nSo after dinner, catfish, PORK CHOPS TO DIE FOR!! So tender, fried hot wings, mac 'n cheese, mashed potatoes, LOTS AND LOTS of hot sauce, we heard the band start warming up.   YES!!  GREAT music.  People walked in wearing their Sunday best and others walked in wearing jeans.  It's an everyone knows everyone's name type of place.  Older people and the younger started trickling in around 8PM.  \n\nDefinitely a fun experience.  Good times."
1,"This is a super classy Fry's! They have a Starbucks, nice floors and lighting, and a natural foods sections, which I love! Healthy and organic shopping is becoming a lot easier to do at Fry's. Great deals and savings on milk!"
1,"One of my all time favorites and the closest thing to authentic Mexican food I've seen in a restaurant (and being 100% Mexican American with a mother who is a great cook, I am PICKY about Mexican food). Do yourself a favor and try their lengua tacos. Long story short, though, I've never had a bad meal here!"
1,"I love this place! Good for all ages and relatively cheap, a win-win!!\nIf you park in the heritage parking lot they win discount your parking ticket to only $3 bucks and its usually $12! another win!\n\nWe went and checked out bodyworlds and the brain, and if you have never been here, YOU have to go and check it out. Even if you have gone and you know someone who might enjoy it, i think it is the type of place you can go again and see/learn things that you missed your first time through. \n\nWe ended up on level two playing in the kids area( don't be fooled they have pretty cool stuff in there). plus, its o.k to let your inner kid out sometimes. :)\n\nA definite must see, and i won't be surprised if i end up back here again.\nVery cool!"
1,"I couldn't believe it... I finally got my first cracked windshield last month. A quiet, unassuming little \""tink\"" sound and that was enough to start a crack that spanned the width of my windshield. Obviously an event to truly make anyone's day. So I turned to Yelp looking for some recommendations and came across these guys. Good reviews! So I called them and a few other places for some quotes and they came in as the lowest and stated they used glass from the same manufacturer that my original windshield was from. On top of that they were friendly and quite helpful. Sold!\n\nThe day came and I have to say I definitely picked the right people. Installation was a breeze, the tech was awesome and didn't mind my hanging out and watching (hey... I've never seen how this stuff gets done) while talking about video games and anything else. SUPER friendly, SUPER qualified. I couldn't be happier."
-1,"I'm not about reviewing fast food places, but I found out this Arby's was the first in Pittsburgh. It even has the HUGE cowboy hat out front as a marker. \n\nIt has all the stuff you'd expect, Roast Beef sandwiches, and those amazing Jamocha Shakes Arby's is known for."
-1,"We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati, and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at Morton's in Pittsburgh. Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey."
-1,Food and decor are horrific. Only redeeming factor is its location; well that and the fact that it's closed 8 hours a day.....
1,"The more I go, the more i fall in love with this store. i love cooking and this is the only place where i can get those \""weird\"" ingredients."
-1,"Ugh. I realize now that any place with the words club, factory or n things in their name I'm gonna give 2 stars or less. Or the word rainforest. But that's a different story. I dared to try something exotic. Salt and pepper shrimp. Hey, I'm Scandanavian. Pepper is an exotic spice to my people. But, I'm sorry, pepper must have been 86d that day. It was more like Salt shrimp. Or Soggy ass salt shrimp. Not good. We had the obligatory chain restaurant appetizer combo. No Awesome Blossom here folks. But overall this beat the entrees. Chased down with a lychee nut cocktail I was ready to quit this club. Service was amiable, but we were stuck in a corner, blocked in by a large party, with, ugh, children. Or as I so affectionately called them, Children of the Corn. Not much joy in this club. Or luck with entree selection. So I say no. No to the Joyless Luckless Bamboo Club."
1,"Mothers Day Brunch was awesome from the lamb comps, prime rib, crab legs, Belgium waffles, bacon, omelette, shrimp, sausage and orange juice. Great service and totally stuffed to the point where we could barely move afterwards."
-1,"Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!\n\nIf I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple."
1,"19 times out of 20 when we get Red Devil it's pizza and it's take out.  The pizza a really good and perfect take out.  If I had to be critical I'd say it can be a tad greasy, but its good pizza.\n\nIn the dining room the Italian food is really good.  The Chicken parm is perfect and all the dishes are quality with generous portions.  \n\nIf you want classic Italian you can't go wrong at Red Devil (and that goes for all the locations)"
1,"Attended a buzzcation event tonight at Morton's. The venue was great and the right size for the amount of attendees, the food was GREAT and the service was the best I have seen at an event of this size. They served endives with blue cheese, salmon pinwheels, filet sandwiches and a tomato brioche that was superb. I hope they re book here for another event - either way I am sure to go back."
1,"You can't beat the price for the quality. If you're looking for upscale and expensive, go to Scottsdale. Otherwise if you want downhome and good swing by Texaz. The Freidy's Filet is awesome!"
1,"This is a pretty cool little store. They have both salt and freshwater fish, which is nice because right now I only keep freshwater. I was a little disappointed in the selection of fish as I prefer fish that don't look like fish (knife fish, eels, hatchet fish, etc), but they had an amazing variety of plants that all looked very healthy and were fairly priced. The employee that helped me was extremely helpful in both the selection of the plants and the care. He also gave me a few tips for my fish even though I didn't buy any fish there. It's a nice shop and I'll probably will be going back."
1,"I don't go to a heck of a lot of movies in theatres (I'd rather curl up with my beloved NetFlix with a beautiful glass of wineand watch on my 5' x 7' theatre projection screen,  than walk on popcorn and lean my head back on a chair on wonder how many other heads of hair were here last).\n\nBut I have to say, there the experience at Cini Capri makes the theatre going experience something I don't mind going to in this cinema.  \n\nNow, if only they had a full service bar - why don't movie theatres do that, btw ??  (that's why the minus 1 star...)"
-1,It was good but parking sucks and the chicken looked pink and I asked if it was ok to eat and they said that's just the way the chicken looks. So we will see if I get sick. Also they had problems with their soda machine.
-1,"OK place and i will probably try them again, however, the down side is that their prices are somewhat high and some cases comparable to new stuff on sale at Menards or Home Depot.\nIf you intend to pay more for a good cause, then it is OK, however, if you are looking for a good price on used and reused items, that is tougher to find at the Madison restore.\nI miss the st vincent depaul dig and save, they used to have building materials for good prices and i used to donate to them but they stopped selling building materials.\n\nThe Madison restire also does not carry the same variety as other restore stores, they will actually refuse certain types of items ...\nagain, i will probably stop and visit occasionally, but my expectations of a good deal are much lower."
-1,"I love the downstairs especially during thd winter with the fireplace. ..BUT the service last Friday at lunch at 12:45pm was inexcusable!  No employees for 5 minutes! Then still ignored while handing us menus (no water, no hi, no welcome) just slapped menus down and talked with an employee. When I told her we needed to be done in an hour ... she just looked at me and said I dont think so. We walked out! STILL NO WATER AFTER 10 MINUTES and NO ASKING US ANYTHING!!"
-1,"i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however, i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed.  let's start with the good things.  QS has a great atmosphere, it definitely helped the transition from austin.  very chill \""hippie\"" vibe.  however, the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch \""hippie-elitest\"".  the food was alright.  their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things.  i do love their thai dressing, very yummy on the salads.  will i continue to go back?  probably, wishful thinking is  a good thing."
-1,"I ordered take out from here last night, and I love the idea of having New York filtered water in your crust. This is supposed to be the ingredient that makes real NY style pizza taste the way it does. I ended up ordering a sicilian style pizza, and got the full size pie. \n\nMy only complain in general would be the cost for my pie. Total after tax was 29 bucks, and thats a lot of money for just one pie. I understand the cost of food and labor along with the better quality ingredients, but I don't even spend that much on an Oreganos deep dish pie, and theirs actually taste better! The sicilian here doesn't really stand out. There's not enough sauce or cheese, and the toppings are just so so. The crust was nothing special, and I honestly thought that Pizza Hut's pan pizza tasted better. I got the Vinny, which has five toppings on it, and split my pizza with two on one side and three on the other. I got meatballs and tomatoes, and pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. Meatballs were dry as shit and sliced. Even Barro's has better meatballs! Everything else was just so so, I can get the same thing but better at Barros, at a fraction of the cost! \n\nAll in all, two stars for high cost and nothing to back it up. I get it, a bunch of people hype up your joint and that's fine, but follow through with it and make that 30 dollar pie blow my taste buds out of the water!"
-1,A place Gordon Ramsay should visit.
-1,"I pretty much knew that visiting this place was going to leave a lot to be desired.  The food here isnt/hasnt been/never will be good. You would think for a place that advertises wings that they would be better but nope, they suck. Knowing this, this time I ordered the buffalo chicken sammich and my friend ordered some cheese sticks. Now the sandwich only comes with beans or coleslaw, to add French fries is extra. So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else. \n\ncustomer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any. The beer was good and cold...like it was posed to be. The place was LOUD too...which actually worked in my favor and helped to distract my kid. Other than that, I don't really have many good things to say about this place. Umm...it was clean. Yup. That's it."
-1,"I inherited a Muzak account from the previous business owner.  I couldn't believe that anyone would pay over $100 a month for this crappy service.  Every time the wind would blow we would lose the connection to the dish on the roof.  $300+ service fee for some guy to drive 4 hours to fix it.  Unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that.   I immediately canceled the service only to to told that there was some 60 month contract of  which I or the previous owner had never seen..........I'll let my lawyer handle that one.  \n\nIf you are using Muzak, I recommend you get out ASAP.   Sirius satellite service is only $25 a month and even better is their internet radio for $35 a month and both have much better selection, and you can make the changes on the fly.  \n\nAn even better option and the one I went with was Pandora DMX business service.  It is only $25 a month and you can tailor make the music to suit your needs, changing the stations is easy, and the system is programmable to allow you to set schedules, etc..  Much more feature reach than anything that crappy Muzak offers and less than 25% of the cost for me."
-1,"We stayed at the Shadyside Inn for months and spent thousands of dollars. I really wanted to write a good review, but the experience was disappointing. \n\nThe quality of service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude. When we provided feedback to the manager (Carol S.), she was extremely disrespectful. She was not receptive to customer feedback at all, and her response was very unprofessional, to say the least. \n\nWe also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall).  And the elevator did not work at times.\n\nWe will not stay at this hotel again."
-1,"There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait, Ruby Tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. Anyways, the only reason I keep coming back is because my husband's family LOVES to use their back room for every occasion. Ugh. Can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? \n\nSo since we are forced to show up for family functions I've had cause to try much of the menu, and most of it is average or below. The only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. If you're not getting that, don't bother. I've heard about free cookie Wednesday, but come on, is that really going to drum up that much business? At Eat N' Park, free cookies are a staple. Get it together Max & Erma..."
-1,"Not a pleasant experience.  While looking at the menu, we ordered a margarita and a draft beer.  The beer came in a bottle instead of a draft and the margarita had a terrible funky taste - almost a \""plastic chemical\"" taste.  Next we chose to have chips and dips/salsa.  We were able to choose three dips/salsas and the server brought one that was incorrect.  To his credit, he promptly corrected the error and brought the right one.\n\nNeedless to say we elected not to have dinner and departed after drinks and chips.  There is much better Mexican food and drink in the 'burgh."
-1,"Stayed here  on 4/7 prior to a business meeting.  It had many of the usual Marriott niceties but no Starbucks or availability of coffee that was any better than Folgers or Yuban.  Maybe it's a Wisconsin thing but I thought that nearly every Marriott had reliable, dark roasted coffee.  The room was OK except that they put me in a second floor room that had windows which started at about 5 feet above the floor and the only view was of air conditioning/heating units and I am a lifetime Platinum.  I am not sure if the desk clerk felt it made little difference or what but this is not a crown jewel by any means.  I understand that this place was a Holiday Inn previously but usually hotels converted to the Marriott brand are better than this one was."
1,"I had a good basic hair cut here last week!  I was really impressed.  The stylist legitimately listened to what I wanted and was able to do a basic slide cut to texturize my super fine Asian hair. I'm not sure I'd come here if I wanted a dramatic change to my style, but for a trim and clean-up as I'm growing out, this is more than sufficient, and you can't beat the $13.99 price tag."
1,"Still loving the food!  The crispy shrimp taco's are my fav.  The shrimp are huge, the 2 tacos fill you up.  I tried the Parm cheesr fries, awesome!  This place has great food, only wish they had a full bar, a margarita would set me over the top!!!"
-1,"Time for another riveting review for all my fellow Arizonians!\n\nLet's start by saying I have had dental issues for many years and in that time have seen MANY dentists!\n\nWhen the time finally came to have some serious dental work done  I chose Artistic Dental as I have seen his work on 2 people and was impressed with their results.\n\nBoth of these people had many teeth extracted and partials and or full plates done.\n\nI do realize it is a lab that makes them not the office\n\nI am very nervous going to dentists simply because I know the pain they are capable of inflicting, \n\nWhen I met Dr Daugherty I found him to be friendly and comforting.  The staff was wonderful and did everything they could to relieve my anxiety!\n\nWe came up with a game plan and part of that was to remove some teeth.\n\nLet's talk prices for a moment.. \n\nKeep in mind the office is in the Biltmore area...need I say more?  \n\nLocation and cost does not guarantee better work.\n\nThey are more expensive than any dentist I have seen but....they say you get what you pay for and my smile is very important to me.\n\nI decided to let him do my top teeth and if the results were positive I would let him do the bottoms.\n\nIt was several weeks before I was to start the work and I had a terrible toothache so I went in and  told Dr Dougherty which tooth was hurting and requested he pull it and that would make one less to be pulled in a few weeks.\n\nWhen he was done I looked in the mirror and was horrified to find he pulled the WRONG tooth!\n\nBecause of this I was embarrassed to smile in fear my big gap would be seen since the tooth was toward the front.\n\nAlthough the Doctor apologized I had lost my faith in him and was now petrified to have the remaining work done...\n\nWhen the time came I put on my \""big girl pants\"" and went back for the other extractions .  I made it clear how nervous I was and Dr Dougherty assured me he would be gentle and I wouldn't feel any real pain......HE WAS WRONG !\n\nSo  what would have happened if he told me the truth?  I now felt lied to ... So let's add things up to this point:\n\nHe pulled the wrong tooth\n\nHe lied to me\n\nHis prices are exsorborant \n\nMoving on... When I paid for the top work I had given them the full amount to cover top and bottom from the estimates they gave me... Although the estimates seemed to keep changing! \n\nThe top teeth, although beautiful simply did not fit right... Even after the alignment ... and the only way to fix it would be to drive the 28 miles each way to his office and leave iit with him and make the same drive back to get them with no guarantees .\n\nI decided to just deal with them and find a new dentist.  \n\nAfter my experience I put the dentist off for over a year and found a wonderful new dentist close to my house\n\nWhen I told this new dentist of my anxiety he was HONEST with me and said there may be some pain for a very short time during injections but they would do their best to distract me.\n\nWhat do ya know... Honesty... And it didn't kill either of us in fact I trusted him completely after that \n\nAt Artistic dental AFTER insurance I would be responsible for appox $1800.00!!!!!!\n\nMy new dentist did the same work for $725.00 after insurance!!  Saving me $1075.00!!!\n\nI called Artisic dental and told them I would like the $800.00 approximate  money they were holding sent back to me so I could get the work done.\n\nI also requested a refund of the \""alignment\"" since it didn't correct the problem. I was told they would speak with Dr and call back\n\nI got a call back and surprise surprise it seems they had a bookkeeping error almost 2 years ago and never billed something therefore they only owe me appox $300.00\n\nEXCUSE ME....WHAT? !\n\nI asked her why they are just finding this error now and why they have had my money for almost 2 years and never bothered to call and ask if I wanted it or if I was ever going to come in again.\n\nI told her that was unacceptable and their error from long ago just won't cut it nor should I be held responsible \n\nI had mentioned to her it would cost me $ 725.00. to have work done and I agreed to accept that and put this experience in the past .. Until.... Yesterday.\n\nI was with my friend who had her work done at Artistic Dental and she also told me of her \"" BILLING ERRORS\"" she had with their office and that is why she has not been back.\n\nIf you are looking to whiten your teeth or do cosmetic work I am sure Artistic will work for you.... But I would think twice about letting them do any serious work. \n\nMy last words of advise are.... Check their billing!!! Make sure they are billing your insurance only once and that you are getting the credits!\n\n\nOn that note I will say...\n\nLive each day as though it were your last and.... ENJOY!"
1,"There is really one reason that I go to China Chili all the time...The boiled wontons.  The rest of the food is pretty typical chinese fare.  Best to take a group of friends and mix and match dishes. \n\nOur favorite dishes here, besides the boiled won tons, are the spicy eggplant and the green beans and tofu.  We order them extra spicy to kick it up a notch. Even extra spicy and Dan will load up both the boiled won tons and the dishes with the hot sauce at the table.  In fact we usually leave the hot sauce jar empty by the time we leave the restaurant.  \n\nParking is a bit hard to find on busy nights there and I usually end up parking on the street.  \n\nThe portions are gigantic and I always have take away dishes for the next day.\n\nPrices are reasonable.  If you do order the soup realize you can order it and share for the table."
-1,"$10 for a medium drink, chicken sandwich, and a small salad = MEH! Overpriced and nothing special of this BBQ chicken sandwich.\n\nI'll go back for a second try, someday..."
-1,"I used to eat here very often when I was study at UIUC couple years back. \nHowever, last year I happened to visit Champaign again and want to have some of my favorite food at Mandarin wok so I stopped by here to have lunch.\nIn my opinion, the quality as well as the taste is sooo much better when it belongs to the original owner. I was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before. I also ordered different kind of foods but nothing can compare to the one usually I had before. If you really want to try a \""real mandarin wok\"" you should go to Mahomet where the original owner open a new restaurant name \""the wok\"""
-1,"If you like waiting for a long time for your appointment, dealing with rude medical professionals, and getting yelled at later when you want your test results sent to your primary care doctor, this is the place for you to go."
1,Had lunch here yesterday and have to say that they have great carne asada burritos.  Fresh Food and a huge portion.  Definitely the best burrito I have had in Phx.  The only downside is the neighborhood--probably not the best place to be at night.  Reminds me of Taquerias in the mission district of San Francisco--yummy
1,"God this place is good.  Stepping into their dinning room is like being with friends.  It's quaint and comfortable and the servers are always friendly.  As for the food, it is equally as enjoyable.  The mac n cheese is to die for and the fish n chips is the best I've had in the valley.  Their homemade tartar sauce is what really sets them apart. \n\nIt's a little tucked away, but quite the gem."
-1,"Maybe I'm ordering the wrong stuff, but I've *always* been disappointed in the grub at 5&Diner... The service was STELLAR and I really do like the ability to dine Al-Fresco at 3am, but does everything need to be soaked in butter flavored crisco??? ughghg."
-1,"We ordered two pizzas and wings on a Friday night over the phone for pick up. They told us it would be ready in an hour. Sure, it's Friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable. My husband showed up an hour later and it was not ready. He had to park illegally because there is absolutely no parking available here and was very worried about the car getting hit. \n\nIt took another 45 minutes before he actually got the pizza. 1 hour and 45 mins is ridiculously long to wait! They should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed!\n\nWhen we tasted the pizza, it was... Okay. The sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland. Kinda like the pizza you'd expect from a street vendor at 3am in the South Side. \n\nWe will never be back and will remain loyal to Krazy Brothers and Molly's Pizza in dormont for now on."
-1,This probably the worst grocery store I've ever been to. It's constantly packed with usually only 2 cashiers helping patrons and as soon as you walk in it honestly smells like crap. I gave it 2 stars because at least the deli people have always been friendly and there isn't much for grocery stores in the downtown area. If you can avoid shopping here  do it you won't regret it
-1,Just a shame. The food is good but service is horrible. I've had nothing but bad servers with no concern for my experience. If you plan to sit at the bar downstairs you better block out 3 hours for lunch. They haven't figured out a way for the kitchen to fire out food for that part of the restaurant. There are too many good restaurants in this area to tolerate the Rokerij.
-1,"I went to the newly renamed 9/05 with a group under the recommendation that they did their tofu dishes really well and catered towards vegetarian foods.\n\nI guess the tofu itself was decent; thick, firm and textured, but the curry (which had been vaunted as one of the best dishes) fell completely flat. Where was the spice? Where was the flavor?? Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? To add insult to injury, everyone else at the table who had ordered the Pad Thai and Bangkok Dynamite dishes sniffling and complaining about the spiciness of their food. \""I'm Mexican\"" whispered one lady \""I LOVE spice, but this is too much with the chili flakes\"". At the end of the meal there was plenty of leftover food which everyone declined to take home. \n\nThe entr\u00e9es started at 10$ and so did the drinks, I was priced out of ordering one of their 15$ \""martinis\"" and stuck with a four dollar beer. The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.\n\nSomeone mentioned that ownership changed hands with the name changing, maybe the good cooks left as well?"
1,"Went with husband, we both remember thinking everything was delicious (been a while since we went). Nice atmosphere and great service too."
1,"Gotta give it 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, from the ambience to the server to the food quality. \n\nTo start, like a reviewer said before me, the valet parking does seem to be for the actual Vincent restaurant, rather than for the Bistro.  And yes, there is parking in the back.\n\n**Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.\n\nWhat we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.\n\nWhat the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)\n\nEverything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not \""bad\"" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.\n\nEven better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!\n\nI will go back again and again.  (And to all you thriving young bucks, this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique, yet unpretentious, with amazing food and a manageable cost.  Score!)"
1,I've been coming to this location for over 2 years. I have had only fantastic service experiences. Never a bad one!!! They make excellent drinks too! True artisans that know their craft well. Solid!
1,"Found a new lunch spot oh yea! Went with some coworkers on a Friday at high noon, guess what yall the place was packed, but we waited about 5 mins and then got seated. Right when you walk in you can see on the counter what the lunch specials are, and I knew before I was seated what I wanted! \nI ordered the Sakana lunch special which was delish! It had rolls, jalapeno stuff crab popper things, tuna, salmon and other fish, came with soup & salad and was 10 bucks!! TEN BUCKS YALL!!! OMG it was delish! I know normally I would not be able to get all that for ten bucks!  \nSushi was fresh and great tasting, service was kinda slow, but it was a very busy Friday lunch rush! I am glad to have found them and to add them to my many lunch spots stops! \nI will be back!"
1,Tried Welcome Diner for the first time tonight.  We did only try the Hurricanes but will definitely be back to try the biscuits. The place is very unique.  We sat outside and it was kind of like sitting in someone's backyard.  They have a walk up window if you chose to sit outside or you can sit inside at the small counter. It was happy hour all day since it was Tuesday.  Awesome!! Service as polite and quick. The Hurricanes were refreshing but not strong. Don't let the neighborhood or decor scared tour away. Can't wait to come back and try the food and other cocktails.
-1,"Looking at all the other reviews about this place, I wondered if we actually went to the same place.  I thought it wasn't very good.  I had the Eggplant Alexander which consisted of a bunch of soggy fried eggplant with a ton of cheese melted on it.  I've made much better at home.  My beloved had veal Parmesan.   Which was dry, overcooked and lukewarm.  Did we catch them on a bad day?  I'll never know because I don't think we'll return."
-1,"Sure, their branding is nice. It has that feel of something hip and youthful, which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local. Pretty colors and shiny things however don't impress my palate.\n\nI can't explain how much I detest food from Zoe's. Fresh vegetables, grilled meats -- it should be a slam dunk. Instead, their food is BLAND. It is the inverse of food, it is anti-food, annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite."
1,"Walked in here one night randomly spoke to the owner and he hooked me up on a pizza. It was really good, the sauce is really tasty. I would def come back."
1,"I live in Peoria so the haul down to the bar was quite a distance. However, it was quite worth it on a Wednesday night. I went to hear the Karaoke and was pleasantly surprised to realize that it was indeed quite good! The \""regulars\"" came out and sing to their hearts content. Country, Rock, Easy Listening... good stuff!!!\nThe Wednesday night special was also delicious, as were the fantastic rum and Cokes. The bartender was always ready. Always helpful! I only had two drinks, but, \""Sheesh!\"", that did it for me!! I'd love to go back to that place...on a weekend. When I don't have to be at work the next day at 4am. \nBTW, watch out for the floor/handicapped ramp as you enter/exit the building. It'll get ya!"
-1,"I don't know what \""Chicago style\"" bar-b-q is, but if A&J's really serves it, I don't like it. The restaurant smells very good so I had high hopes.  However, the meat did not look very appetizing and tasted very dry.  The sauce is very, very thin, which I don't like. Sadly, I won't be going back."
-1,"During my 5 nights stay at Ritz,  I went to  Bistro 24 for breakfast my first morning.  I experienced very slow service for Ritz standards.  I had to wait a while for someone to wait on.  It was not even busy.  For the next 4 days, I just walked across the street to Starbucks."
-1,"Wow. One of the worst meals I've had in awhile.\n\nMy husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.\n\nSoon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  \n\nWe both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left. I hate KFC and I would much sooner eat that than eat here again.."
-1,"Went yesterday after my daughter's college graduation.  When the grad ceremony ran longer than expected, I called the hostess to let her know we had been delayed but were departing and hoped to be there soon.  As we were sitting in traffic, I received a call from a man who identified himself as the general manager and rudely asked if I still intended to be dining there.  After I explained our delay and that I had just spoke with the hostess, he (again very rudely) wanted to know how much longer I thought it would take for me to get to the restaurant.  \n\nWe arrived at Lydia's about 30 minutes late for a mid-afternoon reservation.   There were several large parties but quite a number of open tables.  Upon presenting at the hostess table, neither the hostess or the general manager acknowledged us for several minutes while they continued some discussion between the two of them.  We were seated at a small round table tucked in a corner - very small for a party of five.\n\nOur server arrived and explained the menu, which was the buffet brunch at the time. He spoke so quickly and mumbled so much that we had trouble understanding him.  We ordered our drinks and he indicated he would take our order when he returned with the drinks.  He later returned without our drinks and told us that they needed to break down the buffet to prep for upcoming dinner service so we could not have the antipasto or dessert portions of the brunch. Instead they would charge us ala carte but we would be limited to the entrees on the brunch menu and they could provide a Caesar salad or cup of soup.  He the left and returned later to take our order - still no drinks. \n\nWe eventually received Caesar salad (not fresh, limp and overdressed) and drinks.  We were seated within view of the antipasto buffet and were able to observe that we were on to the service of our entrees well before the antipasto buffet was broken down. Clearly there was no reason that our menu needed to be so restricted.  \n\nFood was ok.  Chicken was salty and overpowered by capers.  Individuals who ordered pasta trio indicated two of three were good.  Unfortunately, the table set up required the server to hold the pasta skillet over my lap in order to serve those seated on the other side of the table.  No mishaps but a few close calls.  Amounts provided in first serving were small and it was nearly impossible to get an additional serving.  Two individuals never did receive the second serving of one of the pastas that they requested.  We were able to order from dessert menu.  Desserts were unremarkable and very small.  \n\nService was horrible.  Our server did not return.  Took great effort to flag him down for additional drinks.  House wine and mimosa were overpriced at $12 and $13 respectively given size and quality.\n\nGentleman bussing our table was the only positive of our experience. He was friendly and accommodating.\n\nI will not return again and would discourage others as well."
-1,"Went to check out a game with some friends and was horrified at our service.\n\nOne of our party received a cold pizza roll and brought it to our server's attention. \n\nHow tacky can one be in deciding to stick one's finger in a patron's food and declare the patron wrong?\n\nUnbelievable. \n\nAnd then the manager decided to get in on the action. He made a special trip to our table to declare the server was correct in her statement and her action because she was requested to stick her finger in the food in question.\n\nReally?\n\nIf this is any indication of how customers are treated at Picasso's, rest assured that members of my party took note and WILL spread the word.\n\nMy first and last visit. \n\nThank you for a great football Sunday."
1,"I wish we had a happy hour sushi bar that started at 10pm for the night lovers in all of us in Charlotte, NC! Zen 32 offers $3-$6 happy hour sushi rolls, appetizers, and some drinks from 10pm-2am. \n\nThe quality of the sushi was very good! I wish at the time I would have been more hungry, I could have eaten it up! The spicy tuna and vegetable rolls were great...I can't remember the other rolls we ordered, but just as delicious.\n\nThe downfall was the service. Initially we were greeted by the hostess, but it took approximately 18 minutes for a server to show up. Typically that would have been unacceptable and I would have said something or just left, but it was on New Year's Eve and was a reunion with friends that I had not seen in a long time so we were just chatting. However, I think the hostess caught on to how long it had been because when we eventually started looking around we caught her eye and within another minute, our server showed. \n\nThe atmosphere is dim and intimate. They also have a patio (with heat lamps). Overall, I enjoyed my experience and the food was delicious! Next time I'm in town, I'll visit you again Zen 32!"
1,"Fast, fresh, delicious...how can I not love it?"
