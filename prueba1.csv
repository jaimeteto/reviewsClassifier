-1,"Eat at Fioris, they said.  Youll like it, they said.\n\nis it conveniently located on West Liberty Boulevard, this restaurant features absolutely nowhere to park on the road that is impossible to get to.\n\nWhen I called to place our order a miserable sounding me an answer the phone with the side and then said what do you need? I placed our order and he said don't come down here it's going to be at least an hour to we can get to you if my coworkers can do anything right. That was really unprofessional. Some people may think that character but really I don't care what kind of a day the person taking the pizza order is having I just want to place my order without feeling im bothering them,\n\nYou should know that you will have to illegally parked your car to pick your order up.  the place was filthy inside and it was packed full of people and total mayhem. I would never ever recommend eating in store even if the place was clean up you're still going to have people waiting to pick three orders of standing right over you. It was also about a hundred degrees in there. They also only take cash with they didn't mention and there was no sign so I was glad I had cash on hand.\n\nI knew that something was up with the pizza 13 started leaking through the lid of the pizza as we were driving it home. The bottom and the top rated with grease. How does that even happen? My friend said that's a sign of a great pizza but he is a guy and we have other eating priorities it was disgusting. You're not supposed to take a slice of pizza up out of the pizza box and have all of the toppings slide off due to thebgrease.  the only restaurant that could get away with pizza that greasy is Vincents and they are now gone..you could caulk a bathtub with the cheese that's how rubbery it was. It was disgusting. the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added. It was gross I don't understand why anybody likes this restaurant but the poor service and the poor quality of the food is a prime example of a restaurant resting on the laurels of its legacy."
-1,"I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a \""lemon\"" of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \""meat,\"" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \""amazing.\""  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades."
1,"This is my go to place for a really good beef enchilada. The red sauce is always flavorful, and the combo with rice and beans will surely satisfy your cravings. Even the rice and beans are delicious, and remind me of home. I'm never afraid to just order a good ol' bean & cheese burrito. With their salsa verde, it is the perfect choice if you just want something simple. Of course, they do have carne asada, a typical staple for any Mexican food joint, and theirs is pretty darn good. I always get it as a quesadilla, and I'm always happy with the decision. Don't let their old school tables fool you, this place is full of good food!"
-1,"Not impressed. When I ordered the Oyako bowl, the conversation went something like this: \nMe: What type of sauce comes on the Oyako bowl? \nFemale employee: Chicken \nMe: Yes, I know it has chicken in it, but what type of sauce comes on the chicken and rice? \nFemale employee: Chicken sauce \nNico: Just order it Teresa \nMe: Ok, can you substitute noodles for rice, please? \nFemale employee: Puzzled look of total confusion \nMe: Repeated the above question \nFemale employee: Uhhh, no, no substitute for noodles \nNico: This is not the time to be picky Teresa \nMe: Fine (as I'm looking at the sign that states \""Substitute noodles for rice for $0.80) \n\nNow I can see why the employee was so confused. There was NO sauce in my rice bowl. It was just chicken, rice, egg, and green onions. I had to add soy when we got home and I am not a huge fan of soy. Nico raves about this place and he very much enjoyed his Teriyaki rice bowl. I will go again and try something else, and I will probably make him order for me."
-1,"This is the first time ever I wrote a bad review but I am just that frustrated with Hertz CLT.  I was nodding my head on all the negative reviews on Hertz CLT location cause that is my personal experience also.  I am a Gold Circle member but apparently it makes no difference at this location.  I got on-time Carfirmation once out of five rentals in Sept  and your name is not on the board either.  It is true the lines are super long and not unusual to wait in line at least for 20 mins or more even if you are a Gold Circle member and that you had reserved the car properly.  It is also embarrassing to drive a car to the client site, of which has dents and scratches all over.  One time the car they gave me has 67,000 miles on it and the Hertz employee wrote on the paper dents and scratches all over because there were so many.   Most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful.  I asked why I don't get Carfirmation or find my name on the board, the lady just rolled her eyes and there was no apology.  It is also true you always have to wait for the shuttle.  I would see two Avis shuttle come and go and 10 or 15 mins later I will see the Hertz shuttle.  I have also completed survey and sent in complaints to Hertz but nothing has changed.  The only reason I have not switched is because of good services received at other cities and my assignment in Charlotte ends in Dec and I don't have to deal with Hertz CLT any more.\nRichard... Thanks for your response.  RR 543397190 has miles out 66,900 (9/21/14) and miles in at 67,054 (9/27)"
-1,"I don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food.  The place is dated and could use updating.\n\nThe waitress was good.  I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.\n\nThe food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it.  Her first bite she made a sour face.  My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that.  Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto.  The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. \n\nMy son and I had the fried seafood platter.  Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor.  The breaded shrimp tasted weird too.  Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. \n\nOn the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good.  The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's.\n\nThis was our first, and more than likely, our last, visit.  For a $65 dollar meal, it wasn't worth $10. ."
1,"This is a frequent dining spot for me. There are not to many options in downtown Phoenix, however this place has a great variety. I am not a sandwich gal or a fan of deli's though Paradise Bakery has a great variety on their menu to offer for all types of eaters. Everything is fresh. They have daily soup options and tasty crisp salads to go. As far as the deserts (cookies, brownies, etc) All I can say is YUMMY! \n\nThe staff is always friendly. The management team is always upbeat and greets all visitors who walk through the door. \n\nThere is indoor and outdoor seating. This place gets busy so they offer call in to go orders. \n\nFor a healthy option this is the place to go."
1,I'm pretty happy with my purchase today. I found a pair of man's sandals and looked like it's under sale. The store guy told me it was on sale last week but no longer. Then I asked if he can do me a favor to give me the sale price and he agrees. I checked out but continue shopping for something else and got about $40 other things. I then asked the check out guy if I can return that shoes and combine all the things I want to buy so that I can use a 10 off 50 coupon. He agrees with the manager's consent and did working for a while to return my shoes and combine my stuffs together.
1,"This is by far one of my favorite spots!! \n\nIt's kind of hidden near the theater area, so it can be hard to find. The inside is dark and chic. It's classy and trendy. This place is for almost everyone, there are hipsters and the \""I live in the biltmore estates\"" and just regular people. It's great! It's perfect for when you don't feel like having a wild night and just enjoying a quieter night with friends. Their drinks are Delish! And so are the appetizers! Service is awesome! Music is good!\n\nAwesome place all around!"
-1,"Do not use this dry cleaner. The staff/owner smokes in the store. There are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around. I had to \""air out\"" my clothes after I picked them up from Galardi's to try to get rid of the cigarette smell. YUK!"
-1,"What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my \""go-to\"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  \n\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \""qualified\"" for delivery to the store.  \""When will the items be restocked?\""  \""Don't know.\""  \""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\""  \""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? \n\nThe staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \n\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \n\nVERY disappointing to me."
-1,"I have heard a good amount of positive reviews of this place from lots of different people. That being said, I was expecting to be wowed by their burgers, which is the reason people told me to go. \n\nHowever, when I arrived with my guest, 8:00 PM on Thursday night, I was kind of disappointed. Not only did the waitress take a good 10 minutes before she brought us water, but she was not very attentive and never checked back with us until she brought the bill. The burger was so-so with little flavor, which was very disappointing. I could also tell that a few other tables in my section were looking around waiting for their server.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed by the quality of food as well as the service."
1,"This is just a standard TGI fridays rebranded for the baseball park.  That being said, we no longer have TGI fridays in Hawaii, so the food was a new experience for me.  I went on a Monday at noon, so as expected, there was not many people.  We were able to sit by the windows that overlook the park, which was breathtaking to me.  (Dont have a professional baseball stadium in Hawaii either) \n\nSo, in terms of the food, my Auntie and Grandparents got the endless lunch.  Around $7-8 I think.  It came with Unlimited Breadsticks, soup and salad.  Only bad thing is that the French Onion is a one-order soup, and not unlimited without a small charge.  Thats bad because I absolutely LOVE french onion soup.  But my Grandparents and Auntie loved their food.  \n\nI had the Korean Beef tacos.  Love it.  Good flavor, and rather large portion.  (TIP from my Auntie, ask for potsticker sauce on the side and pour it on the rice and/or tacos) \n\nThe customer service was great, our waitress was super friendly and conversational.  Since it was pretty much empty, we walked outside to look at the stadium from the balcony they have.  While we did that, another employee got confused and cleared away our drinks and utensils.  Our waitress noticed before we came back and replaced it all.  She also took our picture outside for us.  Shame I dont remember her name to give her recognition on here. \n\nOverall, \n\nFood- 9/10\nPrice: 7.5/10\nLocation- 10/10\nCustomer Service: 20/10\n\nThe food and everything else was great, but it was the waitresses customer service that absolutely put it over the top."
