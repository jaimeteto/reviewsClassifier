-1,"Eat at Fioris, they said.  Youll like it, they said.\n\nis it conveniently located on West Liberty Boulevard, this restaurant features absolutely nowhere to park on the road that is impossible to get to.\n\nWhen I called to place our order a miserable sounding me an answer the phone with the side and then said what do you need? I placed our order and he said don't come down here it's going to be at least an hour to we can get to you if my coworkers can do anything right. That was really unprofessional. Some people may think that character but really I don't care what kind of a day the person taking the pizza order is having I just want to place my order without feeling im bothering them,\n\nYou should know that you will have to illegally parked your car to pick your order up.  the place was filthy inside and it was packed full of people and total mayhem. I would never ever recommend eating in store even if the place was clean up you're still going to have people waiting to pick three orders of standing right over you. It was also about a hundred degrees in there. They also only take cash with they didn't mention and there was no sign so I was glad I had cash on hand.\n\nI knew that something was up with the pizza 13 started leaking through the lid of the pizza as we were driving it home. The bottom and the top rated with grease. How does that even happen? My friend said that's a sign of a great pizza but he is a guy and we have other eating priorities it was disgusting. You're not supposed to take a slice of pizza up out of the pizza box and have all of the toppings slide off due to thebgrease.  the only restaurant that could get away with pizza that greasy is Vincents and they are now gone..you could caulk a bathtub with the cheese that's how rubbery it was. It was disgusting. the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added. It was gross I don't understand why anybody likes this restaurant but the poor service and the poor quality of the food is a prime example of a restaurant resting on the laurels of its legacy.",,,,,,
-1,"I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a \""lemon\"" of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \""meat,\"" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \""amazing.\""  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades.",,,,,,
1,"This is my go to place for a really good beef enchilada. The red sauce is always flavorful, and the combo with rice and beans will surely satisfy your cravings. Even the rice and beans are delicious, and remind me of home. I'm never afraid to just order a good ol' bean & cheese burrito. With their salsa verde, it is the perfect choice if you just want something simple. Of course, they do have carne asada, a typical staple for any Mexican food joint, and theirs is pretty darn good. I always get it as a quesadilla, and I'm always happy with the decision. Don't let their old school tables fool you, this place is full of good food!",,,,,,
-1,"Not impressed. When I ordered the Oyako bowl, the conversation went something like this: \nMe: What type of sauce comes on the Oyako bowl? \nFemale employee: Chicken \nMe: Yes, I know it has chicken in it, but what type of sauce comes on the chicken and rice? \nFemale employee: Chicken sauce \nNico: Just order it Teresa \nMe: Ok, can you substitute noodles for rice, please? \nFemale employee: Puzzled look of total confusion \nMe: Repeated the above question \nFemale employee: Uhhh, no, no substitute for noodles \nNico: This is not the time to be picky Teresa \nMe: Fine (as I'm looking at the sign that states \""Substitute noodles for rice for $0.80) \n\nNow I can see why the employee was so confused. There was NO sauce in my rice bowl. It was just chicken, rice, egg, and green onions. I had to add soy when we got home and I am not a huge fan of soy. Nico raves about this place and he very much enjoyed his Teriyaki rice bowl. I will go again and try something else, and I will probably make him order for me.",,,,,,
-1,"This is the first time ever I wrote a bad review but I am just that frustrated with Hertz CLT.  I was nodding my head on all the negative reviews on Hertz CLT location cause that is my personal experience also.  I am a Gold Circle member but apparently it makes no difference at this location.  I got on-time Carfirmation once out of five rentals in Sept  and your name is not on the board either.  It is true the lines are super long and not unusual to wait in line at least for 20 mins or more even if you are a Gold Circle member and that you had reserved the car properly.  It is also embarrassing to drive a car to the client site, of which has dents and scratches all over.  One time the car they gave me has 67,000 miles on it and the Hertz employee wrote on the paper dents and scratches all over because there were so many.   Most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful.  I asked why I don't get Carfirmation or find my name on the board, the lady just rolled her eyes and there was no apology.  It is also true you always have to wait for the shuttle.  I would see two Avis shuttle come and go and 10 or 15 mins later I will see the Hertz shuttle.  I have also completed survey and sent in complaints to Hertz but nothing has changed.  The only reason I have not switched is because of good services received at other cities and my assignment in Charlotte ends in Dec and I don't have to deal with Hertz CLT any more.\nRichard...

-1,"I don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food.  The place is dated and could use updating.\n\nThe waitress was good.  I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.\n\nThe food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it.  Her first bite she made a sour face.  My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that.  Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto.  The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. \n\nMy son and I had the fried seafood platter.  Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor.  The breaded shrimp tasted weird too.  Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. \n\nOn the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good.  The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's.\n\nThis was our first, and more than likely, our last, visit.  For a $65 dollar meal, it wasn't worth $10. .",,,,,,

Then I asked if he can do me a favor to give me the sale price and he agrees. I checked out but continue shopping for something else and got about $40 other things. I then asked the check out guy if I can return that shoes and combine all the things I want to buy so that I can use a 10 off 50 coupon. He agrees with the manager's consent and did working for a while to return my shoes and combine my stuffs together.,,,,,,

-1,"What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my \""go-to\"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  \n\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \""qualified\"" for delivery to the store.  \""When will the items be restocked?\""  \""Don't know.\""  \""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\""  \""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? \n\nThe staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \n\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \n\nVERY disappointing to me.",,,,,,

That being said, I was expecting to be wowed by their burgers, which is the reason people told me to go. \n\nHowever, when I arrived with my guest, 8:00 PM on Thursday night, I was kind of disappointed. Not only did the waitress take a good 10 minutes before she brought us water, but she was not very attentive and never checked back with us until she brought the bill. The burger was so-so with little flavor, which was very disappointing. I could also tell that a few other tables in my section were looking around waiting for their server.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed by the quality of food as well as the service.",,,,,,
1,"This is just a standard TGI fridays rebranded for the baseball park.  That being said, we no longer have TGI fridays in Hawaii, so the food was a new experience for me.  I went on a Monday at noon, so as expected, there was not many people.  We were able to sit by the windows that overlook the park, which was breathtaking to me.  (Dont have a professional baseball stadium in Hawaii either) \n\nSo, in terms of the food, my Auntie and Grandparents got the endless lunch.  Around $7-8 I think.  It came with Unlimited Breadsticks, soup and salad.  Only bad thing is that the French Onion is a one-order soup, and not unlimited without a small charge.  Thats bad because I absolutely LOVE french onion soup.  But my Grandparents and Auntie loved their food.  \n\nI had the Korean Beef tacos.  Love it.  Good flavor, and rather large portion.  (TIP from my Auntie, ask for potsticker sauce on the side and pour it on the rice and/or tacos) \n\nThe customer service was great, our waitress was super friendly and conversational.  Since it was pretty much empty, we walked outside to look at the stadium from the balcony they have.  While we did that, another employee got confused and cleared away our drinks and utensils.  Our waitress noticed before we came back and replaced it all.  She also took our picture outside for us.  Shame I dont remember her name to give her recognition on here. \n\nOverall, \n\nFood- 9/10\nPrice: 7.5/10\nLocation- 10/10\nCustomer Service: 20/10\n\nThe food and everything else was great, but it was the waitresses customer service that absolutely put it over the top.",,,,,,
-1,"BEWARE!! \n\nI had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \""it must have vibrated off after service.\"" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \""vibrated off\"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest.",,,,,,

1,"I was unfortunate enough to be stranded in Phoenix a couple of years ago during a major downpour.  11pm, all flights grounded, you can imagine the airport was kind of a mess.  Most hotels were all booked up at that point, but I snagged a last minute room at the Ritz (for something like $450/night, so I must have stayed in one of the nicer rooms).  I'm not a huge fan of having to fight my luggage away from hotel staff, but that's a service many people expect.  The staff at the Ritz offer that and more... \n\nI was pretty impressed by the old world styling of the place because it felt classic instead of outdated.  Even though it was late, room service is always open, so I scarfed down a delicious burger and fries (complete with those cute little bottles of ketsup and mustard) then crashed.  My stay was short-lived, but definitely memorable.",,,,,,
-1,"Wow, where to begin?  We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.  We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\"" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \""kitchen\"" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \""manager\"" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \""sure bet\""!!!  Unfortunately in Anthem the dinning options are very limited and even the Legend Sports Bar (well, sort of a sports bar) is failing as it changes management???  I ordered a pizza there last  week and was told after a 15 minute wait that they had no cheese for the pizza because the whole kitchen/management team just weren't ordering any food?  Wow, what a way to make a transition in business ownership!!! Someone please help these clueless owners/managers!!",,,,,,

Sounds peculiar I know but they mix it perfectly and shave the ice into almost powder mmmmmm.  Very nice owners who run a great business so if you like supporting local business im sure thy could use your business.   Only open for lunch but definintely beats stealing coworkers leftovers from the work fridge.

-1,"This was my first trip to Charlotte. I've looked up other hotels in the area and have decided upon the Omni. The Omni is very overrated. When we checked-in, they had a five day wedding celebration in progress. No bell captains available upon check-in. When we got up to the room, I was very surprised to see how outdated it was for the money. Ripped curtains, blown out light bulbs in bathroom. And most of the extra electrical outlets did not work. I had my cell phone charging, come to find out the outlet never worked. I switched it to another outlet, and, again, no charge. Upon my morning cup of coffee in the room, the mini creamers were sour. I called room service, and they never brought them up. Nor did they refresh the coffee station when they cleaned the room. No fresh creamers and two sugars for two days! I take my coffee serious. Lol. The second day in the morning starting at 7:00 AM, I was woken by a pounding sound of music coming from the courtyard. This was the ritual going on for the wedding. It continued for two hours. If the wedding was going to be honored on the lower floors, they should have put the other guests on the upper floor to avoid all the commotion. The garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days. No one took the responsibility of emptying them. We paid good money for a nice, clean, quite break. Only to have nothing but a out of date room, tons of noise, and a unclean looking surrounding. Guests should have been forewarned of the wedding festivities when booking. Although, the staff was very accommodating, they weren't on a mini vacation, we were. The only thing we were offered was free coffee or a breakfast beverage in the morning ! Also, be aware, if you don't join their rewards club, check your bill for a $9.95 a day charge for Internet. We were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all. See attached pictures.",,,,,,

1,"Newsflash!!  After 10 years of living in the East Central Phoenix area, I have FINALLY found my \""go-to\"" Greek place.   It's like comfort food, but it's the entire restaurant.  \n\nMy cousin and I stumbled into this place --- the location is a bit difficult to find otherwise.  We were waiting for our nail appointment at Andy's salon a few doors down and decided to grab dinner since we had time to kill.  Little did we know what happy customers we soon would be!   An affordable, local, delicious Greek restaurant which quickly earned a #1 rating in my book!  Can't wait to go back and try more!  \n\nThe woman who took our orders and cooked the food was just so wonderful!  She recommended the Spicy Chicken pita to me, so I took her word  (see my Humble Pie review, where I learned my lesson for not following restaurant recommendations!).  It was a great choice!!   My cousin had the gyro pita, which was melt in your mouth delicious too.  We also shared a spanekopita, which was just so fresh and well made.  It was piping hot food, she cooked to order (hold the onions for me!), and the flavors were perfect. \n\nThe portions were great, the hummus was tasty, the pita so soft and perfectly grilled.  The Olympic Flame has even mastered the use of garlic, which many restaurants seem not to be able to manage.

1,"i don't use profanity in my reviews, but i cannot find any other words that can express the hot wings.  they are so fucking delicious it's ridiculous.  the chicken wing is cooked well, where it gets crispy and is juicy in the middle.  there is little fat, you you are actually eating a chicken wing.  i pretty much ate everything off the bone.  they have many different kinds of sauce you can select, mild to suicide, honey, bbq, and those sweet flavors with heat for any taste you're in the mood for.  the hot sauce (the step down from suicide) with the wing itself, created the most delicious hot wing i ever had.  it had heat and flavor, without too much of a vinegar taste.  i seriously wanted to lick the plate.  on wednesday their special is 10 wings for $3.00.\n\nthe only reason why i did not give this place 5 stars was because of the bartender.  the drinks were weak.  they use canned juice and red bull instead of the bulk or spout kind, which i appreciate the taste.  i went up to the bar and said i wanted to do a shot.  i am spoiled and don't know the names of any shots (my regular bartenders knows what me and my friends like and will just randomly make stuff that he knows we'll like).  i tell the bartender vodka is ok, no tequila, something that tastes kind of like fruit punch.  she rolls her eyes with her hands on her hips and mentions they don't have any fruit punch.  i mention that the only thing i can remember the name of is the around the world, and she told me you can't make that into a shot.  hahahaha, that's pretty much all i know it as, she was ridiculous.  she made this grape and pineapple juice crap that hardly tasted like booze (i saw her pour, it was pretty much just juice).  aside from her, the server, who was nice, got mine and my friends drink mixed up.  she had a red straw in the one she thought was the raspberry, but the mandarin was made in that glass, so we switched.  when i ran out of my drink, i asked for another mandarin red bull and she brought me a raspberry since the red straw was in it. \n\nthey do karaoke on wednesday and another night i cannot remember.  the selection of songs is great.  there were newer songs.  they had amy winehouse, hot hot heat, panic at the disco, fall out boy, the entire rent soundtrack (which my friend was excited about).  the ones i was amazed to see were teddy geiger, ryan adams, and jeff buckley.  and if that wasn't all... fuck her gently by tenacious d.  my friends and i have wanted to sing this song at our bar forever, they wouldn't even let us sing it a capella.  it was so rad to sing it, it was like some great accomplishment.",,,,,,
-1,"Basically when we took our car in to see if they would look at the issues with our car they responded like a bunch of mindless monkeys with wrenches. Toyota will not take the time to find the solution to what is wrong with your car. Do not buy from Day or Rohrich, they will not care about you or whatever is wrong with your car. Also, their warranties SUCK.",,,,,,
1,"Maybe my standards are low, but I have always loved this place. The company I work for used to hold training classes in Mesa, and I always tried to make it here at least once for each visit. WH is big in the south, and I think AZ is the furthest western location of any WH. Most are just like any fast food, but you get to see the cook, and they have waitresses who step lively between their various chores.\n\nThe last time I was there , the group of co-workers I was with was amazed at the price we paid. I think the most expensive thing was a NY steak for 10 bucks.\n\nIf you like a \""hangover\"" style meal (breakfast anytime, greasy-but-good burgers, etc.) this is the place. And there's thousands of variations to the basic menu.\n\nGrits, hash browns, chili, greasy/good burgers. And folks that look like they should be servin' them to you.\n\nGod, I wish there was one close by, but my health is better for the fact there isn't.",,,,,,
1,"My friends and I have been coming here for about a year; we have dubbed our Tuesdays \""Sushi Tuesdays,\"" and will continue to give patronage for many more years. If you are looking for great food and great service this is the place to come, its like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert. You could go to one of the many run of the mill sushi joints around town but you would be missing out on what life truly has to offer.\n\nAs previous reviews have stated, there are excellent appetizer specials when you purchase a Japanese beer such as fried calamari, chicken yakitori, edemame and of course pot stickers (fried or steamed) for $1.\n\nMy favorite dinner item is the big eye tuna, they cut a piece right behind the cheek or gill of the fish and call it the big eye kama. The meat is extremely tender and ample, like having a steak except incredibly nutritious. The fish is served with a sweet sauce which is delicious and when eaten with Kirin Light it creates a perfect pair, just ask for it you will not be disappointed. Rolls are excellent as well, some of my favorites would be the Cajun wild fish roll or the crunchy eel roll. The sashimi is always made fresh and promptly, the shrimp, salmon and eel are some of the tasty items I enjoy.\n\nThe Bartender Wes keeps everyone quenched and always has positive energy. Management likes to interact with their guests to ensure satisfaction with all orders, which equals great customer service. \n\nThank you Jun, Taki and April.",,,,,,
1,"I am normally not one for buffets, but Sweet Tomatoes came highly recommended by some family members for a healthy place to go have some soup and salad quickly.  We stopped in one night and really liked it.  The homemade soup selection was plentiful and made it hard to decide which one to try.  The salad bar was huge, fresh and a really nice selection of veggies.  There were many options of pizza, pasta, breads and desserts too.  You certainly shouldn't leave this place hungry!",,,,,,
-1,"I lived in Mozart's Highmont apartment for the past two years. \n\nThe rent is too damn high. It was $730 including utilities when I moved in. If you sign a lease now it's $830. It has hardwood floors... In between the gaping crevices in the floor and splinters galore. The kitchen appliances are 3/4 size so your oven will not accept 11\""X13\"" baking pans and the eyes of your stove are too close to cook more than two items at a time.\n\nThis past winter was very snowy, and Mozart waits until the 23rd hour after snowfall to shovel and salt the walkways, so be prepared to have several near-death experiences getting down the two flights of steep stairs (with short, flimsy, definitely not to code railing). \n\nThey sometimes creep in for inspections, then give you a 'B' without telling you what they didn't like. Aside from inspections, maintenance is really quick for all those pesky problems with the plumbing. The bathtub and sink drip constantly which would be concerning if utilities weren't included. The air conditioning is weak, the heat is hellish and there is very little temperature control since your windows are painted shut.  \n\nThe laundry room is coin operated, it costs $1.75 to wash and to 'dry'. Your clothes will still be soaking wet from the dryer (yes even on high with a clean lint trap). Also be wary of the washers, sometimes people leave them nasty so do a sniff test and a visual inspection before you put your clothes in. The hallways smell like hot garbage, always. They will only be vacuumed shortly after move in in August and right before people start coming to view the apartments in February.\n\nAlso, since the utilities are included, your name isn't on them which means:\n1. When you move on, the utility companies want to say you have no history with them because your name is not on the account.\n2. When Duquesne Light plays with power grid and knocks out your electricity for two days during a 95+ degree heat wave causing misery and spoiling all of your groceries so you are forced to go to the food pantry for months afterward, you can't do anything or be repaid for your losses because of #1. \n\nOne last thing, there is a parking lot, but it costs $75 a month to park back there or you can park on a side street for free and walk 3 blocks with your arms full of groceries. And they will tow you! I was towed within 2 hours after parking back there at (10pm). So park tail-in if you need to use the lot quickly because the tow truck will have to switch equipment to ruin your day.\n\nTL:DR Value for apartment is not great considering all of the other b.s.",,,,,,

-1,"I would NEVER suggest that anyone shop for a used vehicle at this Ford dealership.  The used car Sales Manager is lacking character and integrity.  They had a vehicle priced online right at the price we were looking for so we went in to see the vehicle.  It was a very basic, no feature vehicle for a college student.  Once we agreed to purchase it, they came out with a price $1000 higher than what was listed.  The Sales Manager came out and tried to make excuses for a 3rd party company that posts their sales ads and that it was their mistake...we told him it wasn't our issue.  He then proceeded to LIE to us about the costs they put into the vehicle...since they would never put into it more than what it's worth.  This man should not be in the position he's in, as they could have easily made up for their $1K mistake just in the day and should have honored the price they advertised...and to sit and lie to our face?  Get some integrity loser!",,,,,,

1,"I've been told for a long time that Tutti Santi was a must-try for authentic Italian food in a romantic setting, and I finally got to try it.\n\nThe Phoenix spot on 16th St. (there are five locations) is indeed romantic, since the restaurant is darkly lit with candles on linen-covered tables, with Italian decorative touches in its paintings covering the walls. The restaurant is divided into three parts-a main dining room, a smaller private area and a small bar area. If you mention you're having a romantic evening, and the place isn't too busy, they might even put you in the smaller room all by yourself, which is thoughtful.\n\nThe service is top-notch. Not only was our server friendly and engaging and made us feel like his main focus, but all the other servers who came to our table were friendly and professional.\n\nWe started with the Mozzarella Caprese ($11.95), which had thick hunks of mozzarella and sliced basil atop thickly covered tomatoes, smothered in diced tomatoes. I've never had a caprese dish where diced tomatoes were on top, but I love tomatoes, so I definitely didn't mind! It also came with some spicy peppers and olives, and all the factors complemented each other well.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Homemade Ravioli alla Nina ($15.95), with ricotta cheese and spinach. I was able to get a combo of the tomato sauce and cheese sauce, and you could really tell the pasta was homemade. It was so delicate and almost melted in your mouth, and the sauces were amazing. I felt like the dish was a little too watery and would have preferred the pasta to have been thicker, but I'd rather have thin homemade pasta over pre-made stuff any day.\n\nMy pal got the special, the orange roughy, which looked and smelled amazing. I really wanted to try it even though I don't eat fish, but the aromas were enough to make me know it was a tasty dish-which he agreed on.\n\nWe of course had to try the tiramisu, my favorite dessert ever. There was so much mascarpone cream in the giant piece of dessert, and it was served very traditionally, covered in cocoa powder. The ladyfingers were soaked heavily, and the cream was amazing. It was a really, really good piece of tiramisu.\n\nBesides the scrumptious food, I loved that Tutti Santi had something for everyone, whether you want a romantic date night, an evening out with a big group or just want to chill at the bar and talk with the bartender. No matter what you go there for, it feels warm and friendly.",,,,,,
1,"I loved this car wash..once I figured out how to get into it (easiest to enter from 44th street).  No Cheesecake Factory menu that takes 20 minutes to read and figure out what the difference is between the $4 wash, the $7 wash, the $12 wash...you get the idea.\n\nI took my husband's vehicle in while he was out of town.  I know, I'm nice like that.  $25 for an SUV complete wash.  This is a true hand wash.  No conveyor belts or automated water squirter things.  Guys with hoses who do a really good job.  They use compressed air to dry, and I watched them go over and over the car to make sure nothing was missed.  I was hard-pressed to find any water streaks.  It can be slow, but it's worth it.\n\nThe only downside is the waiting area is outside (covered), so I don't anticipate his vehicle's next wash until November.  Luckily, my 10 year old vehicle has no aversions to machine washes.  But then again, It would be lucky to get washed before November anyway.",,,,,,
1,"I have been sad wishing the Soup or Salads were still open in our area. I was happy to find this place while out shopping.\n\nThe salad bar is stocked with fresh veggies and add ons.

And, the turn around time for rebuilding the motor and pump was incredibly quick.  I will continue to visit Price Busters when I need spa items or help, and I will recommend them to everyone I know.",,,,,,

-1,"Another bad experience two times in a row. There must be a shortage of waitstaff in Charlotte because these people shouldn't even be working at Walmart. Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half. They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana. Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup, waitress looking at me like I was crazy. The manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything I mention I was going to write a bad Yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away. This place used to have a long wait and now there's nobody ever there, now I understand why. Portions are small, service is bad and probably better off going to McDonald's.",,,,,,
1,"Hmm.. I am surprised at the amount of 2 stars with fellow reviewers. Seems sketchy to me.\n\nHere is the deal with Good Fondue:\n\nNot for a family. Yeah, its a romantic type place. Take a date. Or your wife for gods sake. (She likes to go out too!)\n\nExpensive: Yes, in this day and age, good food can still be expensive. Its worth it people. The time it takes to eat an entire meal here is why it costs so much. You take up 2+ hours of their time for 2 to 4 people to eat. They just can't turn tables like your everyday meal type restaurant.\n\nThese meals are meant to be savored. Enjoyed with a good glass of wine, or beverage of your choice. Try to relax here. Enjoy the food, and company most importantly. \n\nThe menu changes a bit from time to time to include a new set of dishes, guessing every 6-8 months. I miss the salad that had heart of palm in it! It was fantastic.\n\nThere is enough variety to actually satisfy 2 different peoples desires in most of their entrees.\n\nDesert, as noted by most everyone on here, is to die for. I have not had one bad desert yet.\n\nThe quick and easy guide to The Melting Pot: Coq au Vin is the baseline cooking that most will love. Traditional Swiss cheese is where \""IT\"" is at. Featured salad is usually a good bet. California salad is a good standby. \n\nDeserts: Try them ALL! Seriously...",,,,,,

-1,We'll it's close to my house and all and they do have products but it is the worst in customer service I think I just might start going to sephora down the road but I been here plenty of times and the ladies don't bother asking if you need help or anything . I walked around the store for a good 45 min the store is a bit unorganized --they seem to only help out older ladies 50s and higher but most of them will just be chatting with other employees . They need to do their job and work other than that it's in a great location .,,,,,,

Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!",,,,,,

-1,"This is not the place to go for dinner.  Period.  They have limited evening hours and it's for a good reason.  During the 30 minutes I was there, not a single other soul ventured in.  I think they save the lunch leftovers and schlep them onto the unsuspecting evening customer.\nI can put up with a lot of things for a cheap dinner.  I don't need good customer service.  I don't need to eat in a safe neighborhood.  I'm not expecting gourmet, either.  \nBut, damn it, when you turn the lights off during business hours while I'm in the middle of chomping down my stale pizza, I'm drawing the line.  \nSure, come for lunch.  I'm always a fan of pizza by the slice places, and if my pizza was fresh, I'm sure it would have been good.  Pretty sure, anyways.",,,,,,

-1,"Everytime I come here they seem to have less and less men's items, specifically designer jeans, which also seem to be getting more and more expensive. \nSelling stuff is a bit different here too. It's consignment so it doesn't quite work the same as Buffalo Exchange where you bring them stuff they take what they want and give you cash or credit on the spot.\nHere, they buy on consignment so they chose the items they want and you get money based on what they sell for AFTER they sell. And they have sales ALL the time it seems.\nLast time I went I sold them 4 pieces and went in today, 3 wks later and nothing sold.\nOf course nothing they took from me was out on the floor. I literally went through every piece. Nothing.\nSeems kinda shady.",,,,,,
-1,I love Pane Bianco--but sadly they have priced me out of their market  for the most part when it comes to sandwiches.  $13 for their tuna sandwich is outrageous--and beyond a price point that I am willing to pay under any  circumstances.  At 9 or even 10 I thought it was reasonably fair and allowed for a tip--at $13  it is not affordable and there is nothing left over for a tip.  I am so sorry that I won't be having lunch there anymore with any kind of frequency.,,,,,,

I took my friend here twice to make sure that the first time wasn't just a fluke.  Our waitress was a total space cadet and was completely uninterested in us.  I realize Denny's isn't a high class restaurant, but I do subscribe to the belief that your water glass should never be empty.  We put our glasses at the end of the table.  The waitress flitted around at the tables behind us (there were two, maybe three other tables occupied when we visited, tops), but didn't cater to our needs.  She treated us like children on both visits.  I told my friend, \""the tip meter is running.\""\n\nI wanted to like Jenny's, but it just sucked.

-1,"So I came on here to \""Rag on Red.\"" Looks like a LOT of people beat me to it. After having a great brunch at St. Francis across the parking lot, my boyfriend and I decided to take a peek in. \n\nWell, first of all, I wasn't sure there was anyone there for a while. Which was fine, we just kept looking around and being goofy looking at all the cool old stuff that they have to offer. As we made our way through the store I found who I could only make out as a sales man sitting in front of some lady on a computer. \n\nThey bothered themselves to greet us at that point. Never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit. (I've worked my way through college/law school doing retail, big no-no not greeting customers and making them feel un-welcomed).\n\nSoooo... I was mindlessly walking around the furniture portion of the store when.......GASSSSSPPPP! I tapped on some of the furniture with my finger nail!!! You would have though I had taken a hammer to it with their reaction. I was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything. Whatever.\n\nI was annoyed with them not wanting me to touch anything but alas, its their store, if they don't want people to enjoy their products that's their business. \n\nWhat blew my top was when my boyfriend (who is very friendly and is always interested in what a business has to offer) asked them a question about a chair. An Egg Chair. You would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending. He asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about.  \n\nAnyway, I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air.",,,,,,
1,been coming here for years because I dream of some day completing a full beer tour.  completed some mini tours but not the big one yet.  this place is always giving me store credit for birthdays and other holidays which is just ducky in my book.  food ain't bad but seriously you're coming here for the beer tour.,,,,,,
1,"I know fellow Yelper Sarah L. will try to outdo me on this review, but I say bring it on.\n\nWe arrived to the restaurant @  6:30 which was our reservation time. We had a large group (12) and the table had already been pre-set. I enjoyed that more than seeing servers scurrying around getting tables together, or worse yet, not having the foresight to ensure that there were enough tables for our group. One thing that I did not enjoy about our arrival was the aroma of slightly fermented fish. Although I despise any fish or shellfish in Arizona (save sushi) I thought this place might have higher standards on freshness. Maybe I was smelling their garbage. In any case, my nose did not  get a good first impression.\n\nWe sat down and ordered beverages. I started with a mojito and water. The mojito arrived quickly but the water did not. After 5 minutes, I asked our server if I could have water. He did not seem upset or irritable about my request. He got it quickly and for the rest of the evening, my water was constantly refilled. \n\nThe service was unremarkable. Which is good. If I remember something about the service, it is because they hover, or forget or get too personal. The staff was friendly, helpful and quite professional. \n\nWe had thought about getting tapas but people started ordering tapas as entrees and I wanted to enjoy my entree fully. On the next visit I will grab some. For my meal, I ordered the paradise pulled pork which is Tender, lean pulled pork saut\u00e9ed with onions, sweet peppers, garlic and\nherbs, laced with habanero chiles. Served with black beans and rice. The server remarked good choice. I asked him if he was lying. He said no and I believed him. \n\nAs people started receiving their entrees, I could tell that they liked them. I did not observe one person from our group add any salt or pepper to their dish. That says a lot about the preparation of the dish. Most of us are picky eaters. As for mine, it was very savory, with an excellent initial taste that leaves a garnish of habanero heat on the palette. I would compare the taste of it to many beautiful entree aromas I have smelled in the past, only to be disappointed by the actual taste. At Havana, they were not lacking in the taste department. Just to clarify, it hit my olfactory area and matched up with my tongue readily. The beans were divine, the rice was standard and unremarkable (use previous definition). \n\nThe night starts to wear down. One of the lights outside on the patio is a bit bright. I order coffee. The mug has an antiquity look about it. Not what I expected at a restaurant. The coffee was memorable. It had a good initial taste, not too hot, but felt like water as it washed down my throat. I am less apt to order it again.\n\nDessert came. My mother order the Marquesa de Chocolate a rich and creamy double chocolate pat\u00e9 laced with Grand Marnier and served with whipped cream and toasted walnut (their words). My friend Nicole tasted it and said it was moussy fudge. Although I did not have any, they were quite keen on it. \n\nFellow yelper Sarah L. glared at me all evening. And with good reason. My review will be better than hers. \n\nOverall, the negs were fishy smell and remarkable coffee. Pozs are great food, unremarkable service and decent ambiance.",,,,,,

1,"I think that it is difficult to differentiate between Lexus service centers as they all adhere to to relatively high standards, but I have to say that Bell Lexus is a a pure pleasure to have my car serviced at.  Like most dealerships I was not only able to book my appointment online but also able to get the first time and date I requested.  When you get to the covered service drive, you are always greeted and walked into your service consultant.  I work with Debi at Bell Lexus and she not only gets everything processed and my car in for service quickly but also always has a loaner ready to go.  This time it was a 2010 RX which made the fiancee happy because she is looking at one as her next car possibly.  It gave us the perfect opportunity to drive it around for the morning and see if it was something that we truly liked. I think we are in trouble because we both definitely thought it was a great car for her.  Back to the service though. I had my car in at 8:30 am and I had a call by noon that my 15,000 mile service was not only done but also my brakes had been replace (under warranty) at no extra charge.  I was back in my car (which they also washed) by 1:30 in the afternoon and on my way.  Overall, great service and experience.",,,,,,

-1,"The Eggery is the exact same franchise as the Good Egg down at Park Central, just fussied up with a different name. Exact. Same. Menu. Bleh.

The service is completely adequate -- nothing horrific, nothing staggering. The food is average, but somehow always arrives cold. At our last visit, there was a metric shit ton of people waiting (including a sweet aging tranny in a muumuu, chartreuse ankle socks, and chunky black heels) but the restaurant proper was only half full, if that. Why? \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be back. There's too many other amazing breakfast places in Phoenix and way too few precious available weekend mornings...",,,,,,

-1,"It's unfortunate their menu only has 4 sandwiches on it. The food was good, albeit leaves a lot to wish for. It came on a plate with a couple olives and nothing else. I would expect more for the $9-11 price tag. \n\nThey market themselves as a sandwich shop but I just don't buy it.  More so, it was a hipster hangout where it seems people go to look cool.  Granted, the few items the did have were quite good, but I just expected a nice turkey sandwich, but that wasn't happening.  \n\nThe service was on the verge of incompetent but the owner did swing by with a loaf of bread.  Too bad we had to ask for oil at the counter to dip it in (our waitress was absent).  \n\nTheir water was unpalatable and they didn't have a lemon, lime, orange or anything wedge to make it slightly less offensive.  My friends that live in Phoenix told me though, this is just the way it is there.   \n\nAll in all, I certainly won't be rushing back but there is plenty of room for positive improvements.",,,,,,

Then late this morning, they called to say they double booked and I would have to come in earlier or way later. I understand things happen, but I rearranged my day to schedule the appt. Too bad Ulta!",,,,,,
-1,"This place was my favorite BBQ in the past. However, now all menu items are smaller, the prices are higher and the sauce is lower quality. I believe smokey Jon can make an award winning sauce but he's not bringing it here. The sides are always top notch the meat is alright but made to be drenched in BBQ, kind of plain alone. All around too expensive for the portion size and used to be a lot higher quality.",,,,,,
1,"First off, I'll admit that this is the only place I'll take my ride too in Down Town Phx. Of course, to be unbiased, that's because its the only place to take your ride too in DT Phx. So, let's be real. 2nd'ly, I drive a Tahoe on big rim's. It's not the easiest thing to clean, and i refuse to do it myself (my own laziness gets a 1 star for car washing, I'm awesome but not THAT awesome). Also, it's black. So double dipper here. The service is fast and friendly, which i love. Danny's needs to take a group field trip here to learn customer service! LO's defiantly has the upper hand in the area. And for the price (i pay about $20 for the works wash every time) it cant be beat and i cant be too sour on it. It's really just minor things; sometimes they forget to wipe out the deep dish rim's thoroughly, or there are minor water spots, or little stains left on the wood grain. Nothing really major, but I just expect perfection every time (which I'm well aware that would only happen if i washed myself, and most likely it wouldn't happen because my ADD would kick in half way through and I would be driving a half dirty half clean whip around town). Also, they have a punch card as well which is very nice! Buy 10, get Numero 11 free. All in All, defiantly 1.5 thumbs up from me; hoping for a full 2 soon.",,,,,,

-1,"Deemos American Grill is a tiny little bar tucked far, far away in the rear (heehee) of the Camelback Esplanade.  In fact, its location is so obscure, I honestly don't know how people stumble upon it.  Deemos is neither interesting nor original; if you do happen to find it, I can't imagine that you would go back.\n\nI, however, did go back.  Let me explain...\n\nFirst, I would like to say that I have been a Deemos patron a handful of times and only on Wednesday nights.  Why Wednesday nights, you might ask?  Well, Wednesday night is karaoke night!\n\nIt all started when a friend of mine called and asked me to go to karaoke with her and of course, I obliged.  I love to tear up a mic every now and then.  I had trouble finding the place (surprise!) and I wasn't terribly impressed when I got there.\n\nThere is a smoking patio outside, so if you're a smoker, that totally rocks.  If you're not a smoker, you may get turned off dodging smoke rings as you walk through the patio to get in the front door.  Inside, there is a U-shaped bar, some high tables, low tables and a couple of booths.  \n\nI'm pretty sure they have a menu, but I've never eaten there and I've never actually seen anyone eating there.  The drink prices aren't great but they aren't really expensive.  I know this because I am a patient person.  The bartenders are awful.  Wait.  Let me tell you what they're good at doing.  They are really good at ignoring you for an exorbitant amount of time, going outside for a 20 minute smoke break, mixing the wrong drink and treating you like they don't really work for tips.\n\nThe ONLY reason I went in the first place and the ONLY reason I went back was the karaoke.  And that's also the reason I gave a 2-star review instead of a 1-star review!\n\nNickstar Entertainment (www.nickstarkaraoke.com) runs the show at Deemos on Wednesday nights from 9pm til 1am.  They are awesome.  They have the biggest selection of songs I've ever seen in my life AND their books are organized.  Their collection is digital.  Their mics are good.  They are fun and genuinely good people.  \n\n\""Dear Nickstar, I am your biggest cheerleader.  You are the only reason Deemos is still in business.  They should thank you... and pay you extra.\""\n\nBut now I have a problem.  I won't be going to Deemos anymore.  Unfortunately, Nickstar is having a censorship problem due to poor management (surprise) and a group of people who have apparently complained about being offended by some of the performances, namely those that incorporate the use of curse words.  \n\nHmmm...  Bar + Drunk People = F-Bombs.  Isn't that a standard people have come to expect?  I can't imagine someone being offended by a couple of curse words IN A BAR.  But apparently, it's become a problem for some and a disappointment to others who enjoy flexing their 1st amendment rights (and their wicked ability to rock a mic).\n\nHonestly, I can't believe that Deemos would sell out like that.  Wait, actually it really doesn't surprise me that much.  The only thing I'm disappointed about is missing out on some great karaoke, but I can catch Nickstar in Tempe (and I will!).\n\nDeemos American Grill, I will never visit your establishment again and I won't miss it.  Shame on you.",,,,,,
1,"We tried this place do to my looking up a place to eat while we were in the area, having our staycation at the Arizona Grand Resort\nHong Kong has to be the best Chinese Buffet I've ever been and I have eaten plenty. Everything was delicious.  We went for dinner so it was 15 and change for adults and our kids were 10 basically.   \n\nThe sushi bar was awesome. Instead of having a chef put out 5 or so different kinds of typical sushi. There is a chef making sushi to order. the menu to order off of is pretty extensive. \n\nMy kids and had quite a few crab legs. The crab legs were also not your typical buffet grade. They were cooked perfectly and the meat was easy to remove and there was a lot of it.\n\nwe didn't try the Mongolian BBq but, we be back.",,,,,,
-1,"Just didn't feel like making dinner tonite, and wanted something quick, yummy and good for me.\n\nI noticed Zoes on my drive home and decided to stop in and check it out. The food was pretty good! I got the grilled chicken platter with a side of rice. I left feeling full (but like the good kind, not the \""on my God I'm gonna pass out\"" kind ;) and satisfied!\n\nI gave it 2 stars because it is kinda generic and there are so many hidden gems to keep an eye out for.\n\n:) Enjoy!",,,,,,
-1,"I am not really a fan of CPK but I went here with a colleague as it was close by where we were working. I figured I would just go with a basic pizza (thin crust) and was less than impressed. For thin crust it was pretty soggy and for me that is a deal breaker. Service was good and friendly but the pizza sub-par IMO. Maybe the other items are better, but I thought I was safe going with a plain pie.",,,,,,

1,"This is the most fantastically delicious Mexican food I have ever had.\nWe started out with a fish ceviche followed by a shrimp ceviche. My daughter had a sea bass grilled and my son ordered a chille relleno. My wife ordered a carne asada fajita. Then we ordered a Molcajete Caliente for 2. This comes in a stone bowl with green sauce and cheese. It has shrimps, fish, carne asada and chicken. All hung on the hot stone bowl like a shrimp coctail!! Needless to say we all were eating each others food!!\nIt hits your taste buds from every direction!! Yum!!\nWe thought we would finish the meal with a flaan. How wrong we were! We just had to order another one. It was so delicious.\nThe quantity is right up there with the quality. We had to pack up the left overs to go. There is no way I was going to let one ounce of this feast go waste.\nThe service was exceptional. Our hostess/server was there like a genie. Water glasses were filled before they got empty, hot tortias appeared by magic, lime when requested materialised. Even when we awkwardly spilled a glass of water, it was soaked dry with a smile.\nI wish I could have this meal more often.\nI know that every time I come to Phoenix, they will have to deal with me!!  :-) :-).",,,,,,
-1,"I've been going to this place for the past 15 years and it's definitely gone downhill recently. I used to rave about the food and service to all my friends, but recently my experiences have been pretty terrible. The owner and his waitstaff look as if they have just given up, there's never a smile on anyone's face, they all just look depressed. The food used to be amazing, but it seems as if they must have changed chefs because now everything usually ends up coming out either over done, or just drenched in way too much sauce. If you complain about the food, the waitstaff just acknowledge the complaint with a nod, walk away, and do nothing about it. I hate to write a bad review because I know how great it used to be, but it just seems as if owner stopped caring.",,,,,,
-1,The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life.,,,,,,
1,Great food! Great service! We will be back!,,,,,,
-1,"I have to disagree with these other reviews.  Presbyterian is a joke.  Unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner, and affiliated with Presbyterian as well, and so any time they want to order up something that they can't handle in the office, guess where they send us?\n\nTo make matters worse, the place is always full (or overfull), always understaffed, and always incapable of handling anything.  The emergency department is horrid, but to make matters worse, it's better than being admitted.\n\nIn one of the worst cases of mismanagement ever, what should have been a simple examination - passed from our regular doctor - ended up being at least 12 hours in the emergency room while we waited for a regular room, then several days (yes days) in the hospital itself while they proceeded to run a whopping one test per day.  That's right - one test per day!\n\nThe test would usually be run in mid-morning, and the results would come back mid-afternoon, at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results, which could take until after dinner, and by the time that happened, it would be night time, and then another test would be ordered for the next day.  It was simply pathetic.\n\nWhatever you do, do not go to the emergency room at Presbyterian.",,,,,,
-1,"CVS is pretty standard, right? Pharmacy, overpriced beauty section (but you sure avoid going to Ulta if you can find what you're looking for there), great sales--on booze, on food, stationery, games--whatever. When I lived across the street, I used to come here at night when I was bored and it wasn't busy. Now, though, there are new employees and unfair practices. On more than one occasion, the employees have held sale items for themselves behind the counter. Today, there were no Connect Four on the shelf, but there was one in the cart behind the counter. When the manager was asked about it, she shrugged and pointed at another employee. I've worked in retail before, and this goes against most store policies. \n\nSo, the next time you get a CVS flyer, remember that if it's okay for the employees to shop the sales for themselves here--then it might be happening all over the place. And if they can put one item behind the counter for themselves, then they can put a lot more for their friends. Prepare to be disappointed. Make the extra trip and hit up Wal-Mart.",,,,,,

Guacamole that came with my chicken fajitas looked like someone had driven over it with a Mack truck and it didn't taste much better. Chicken was grisly and lacked flavor and the peppers were so over cooked they melted in my mouth. Not in that good melt-in-your-mouth sort of way. In my quest to find the best of the Mex in the Midwest, Laredo's didn't have it. \n\nGot a rec? \n\nLet me know.",,,,,,

1,"I've known Dr. Lykins socially for several years.  When my allergist told me I needed to see a ENT and that surgery was probably inevitable, I broke my rule of not seeing friends for care or services.   \n\nHe was extremely thorough and went through my CT scans with me to show me what was going on.  He also described in detail what the surgery would entail and what I could expect in regards to recovery.  \n\nThey were able to schedule my surgery relatively quickly which was a relief because I had to be on antibiotics until I could get this procedure done.  \n\nSurgery was yesterday and as far as I can tell, it went great.  My pain levels are surprisingly low (about what they were pre-surgery which is exactly what Dr. Lykins said).  \n\nIt's too soon to tell how successful this will be in addressing the chronic issues I've been having but all in all, the experience was great.  I would highly recommend Dr. Lykins and his staff.",,,,,,

The only regret is that I didn't give him a bigger tip (I did tip 20% but he deserved more!!!) Very attentive service, very relaxing, affordable and a nice, clean salon. Highly recommend!!!!",,,,,,
1,"La Grande Orange is one of those places that I like so much yet due to so many others liking it forces a strain on my ability to like it.\n\nAllow me to explain. Everything on the menu and in the store is a solid quality product. If it is something to be eaten then it is delicious. If it is something to buy and use in some other form or fashion then it is more than likely a great at whatever it is.\n\nThe area where liking La Grande Orange becomes a challenge is that it is always soo overcrowded with customers that the lines and wait for orders can be pretty long. The parking lot is ridiculously small and fills up fast and is almost always full with one or two cars already camping out for a spot.\n\nThat said, my mouth and stomach convince me that this place is just too good to give up on.\n\nI have been living in Dallas, TX most recently and have thought about how nice it would be to have a La Grande Orange out here. With all of the people recently relocating to the Dallas area maybe those who run LGO should consider placing a location out here.",,,,,,

Our dinner waitress was super nice and was really helpful.\n\nNext time my husband has to come to town again I don't think I'd mind coming along again.,,,,,,
1,I've only eaten here twice but each time the food was awesome and the staff was courteous.  The price is about average for the portions of the food but it is well worth it.

-1,"My first and only experience (to date) with George and Dragon was not very pleasant. When you walk in you are magically whisked away to an all-too-authentic British pub. That's great if what you are after is smelling like an ashtray after a meal of Shepherd's Pie. \n\nThe waitress that served me seemed a little brusque. Maybe that's part of the restaurant's \""charm\""?  The bathroom was in a transitory state of disrepair... or at least I hope it was transitory. I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be in there.\n\nTelevisions are available for watching the soccer match and they have many types of beer on tap. I noticed a jukebox but didn't turn it on for fear of being pummeled severely by the other gruff-looking patrons while the soccer match was on.\n\nThis place has a little bit of an edge to it. If that's what you're into and you're just looking for a spot to grab a beer with a buddy, then check it out for sure. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back again, personally.",,,,,,
-1,"I hate to agree with the other poor reviews of this branch, but this is definitely far from the best Eagle in the city. I'll say upfront that I never felt unsafe the three times that I have been here. However, the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor.

-1,"Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9 used to be a wonderful restaurant. I don't know what's going on there now, but they appear to be having problems retaining good staff. Unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent. \n\nSpicy Curry Beef Linguine used to be a favorite; it was mildly spicy and had delicious curry flavor. Now, it's too spicy to eat, all from jalapeno peppers, and meanwhile the curry sauce has turned into a vague, bland gravy with no curry subtlety. \n\nMeals come with free, fresh baked bread, which is nice. The owners briefly experimented by removing the free bread offering, but it returned a couple weeks later due to customer complaint. Lesson: don't remove the niceties your customers have come to expect from you. \n\nThe service here used to be fabulous; now it is mediocre on a good day and terrible on a bad day. You will be held hostage for your check. Your waiter will come ask \""is everything alright?\"" before you have taken your first bite of food and then never return to see if you need anything else, avoiding all attempts at eye contact.",,,,,,
1,"This is \""my place\""- if you come to town, we eat here. If you want to grab a drink, we'll go here! We even spent one horribly drunken New Year's Eve partying it up with the Rock Bottom crew. This would normally be a 5-star review but I feel like their service has gone downhill a bit in the last 6 months and this could stand to be addressed.\n\nFirst of all, you cannot beat Happy Hour! As a beer snob, I often feel left out when the Happy Hour specials only include America's favorite urine-colored watered down drinks. Occasionally I can get a Sam Adam's or Blue Moon, but it's nothing to match. The specials here vary by the day but you'll be able to get a pint of beer or a mixed drink for around $3- sign up for their free Mug Club and you'll get 20oz mugs every time too! There's a patio with smoking on one side only- it's great to sit out there most of the year but does get packed close to the weekends. \n\nThe food specials at Happy Hour beat the oh-so-cheap yet mediocre Applebee's standard. Most appetizers are $3- a few items, such as sliders, show up just for happy hour and aren't even on the regular menu. There is a burger they offer for $5, and you can get a bucket of fries or kettle chips for $1.50. The sliders are my favorite (both chicken and beef), and i'd also recommend kettle chips, the spinach artichoke dip, or the nachos. \n\nThe beers could almost use their own review- there are 6 or 7 to try and account for what people like to drink. There is usually a special seasonal beer along with a cask-conditioned option. As I mentioned before, the best way to drink beer is with a Mug Club card. You'll get a 20oz mug for the 16oz price and accumulate points towards things such as logo pint glasses. If you like the urine-variety of mass-produced beers, try a Dreamcatcher. If you enjoy good flavor, try the El Jefe Hefeweizen, Desert Trail Pale Ale, or Raptor Red. At this location in particular I think the El Jefe is the best. \n\nThe food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost everything on the menu. The standouts are the Mac N' Chicken, the Lemon Chicken, the Smoked Salmon Fish and Chips, and the Prime Rib (they run specials on this at various times of the year). A lot of entrees come with the wonderful White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the vegetables you are served are pretty flavorful. Definitely good enough to deserve coming here even if you don't drink beer.\n\nMy only complaints lately are that the service has gone downhill. We've been several times in the past few months- 3 times for happy hour and once for dinner. One time at happy hour was perfect, the second our food came out and had clearly been sitting around (coagulated cheese skin on top of the artichoke dip), and the third the food had only sat a tiny bit but it took us forever to get the attention of our waitress. The time we went for dinner the food was good, but it took a long time and didn't come out all at once. If the restaurant can resolve this, it'll earn its 5th star.",,,,,,
-1,"Way overpriced for just ok food.  On a Tuesday night, there was a long wait.  The staff wasn't overly friendly, and when we had to wait, they simply pointed towards the wine bar.  Having never been there before, I was confused by having to pass through the outside to get to the bar.  While I thought the wine bar was cozy, the other customers there were rude and self-centered, ignoring polite \""excuse me\"" by the waitstaff.   When we were finally seated, we waited about 10 minutes before a server appeared.  The food was prompt, and the salad was more than enough to share.  The pizza was simply ok.  I've had much better wood-fired pizza elsewhere.\n\nBeware:  for just a party of five, they added a 20% tip onto the bill.  If you're going to add a tip to a bill, make it the customary 18%.  But frankly, I didn't think they needed to add the tip for us.  Also, do not use multiple credit cards.  I was charged for the entire bill on my card, even though we asked to split it between two.  I'm still waiting for my overpayment to be refunded by the restaurant...",,,,,,
-1,"I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires.",,,,,,

I settled on a cute tank for myself, but still left with no present for her. \n\nOverall, if you;re a fan of Marshalls, you'll be a fan of this location.",,,,,,
-1,"Chico's Tacos is kind of the queenly sister of the chain Mexican restaurants peppered around Phoenix like so many grains of sand in your swimsuit. It is clearly several steps up from your local generic Mexican drive through, but it's still just not tasty.\n\nThis fact does not dissuade me from visiting Chico's on a semi-kinda-regular basis - it is close to my work, and the wait is generally minimal.  Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical \""lunch rush\"" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.\n\nA quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called. \n\nIf you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.\n\nI have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican \""grilled\"" platter, or the entree includes \""grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual \""crunch\""? This is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in. Doused in copious amount of salsa, it's not too bad, but I can't imagine straight-up muching on it without that extra step of preparation.\n\nThe rice is good. I can't comment on the beans, because I don't eat them!\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is cute - much nicer than your usual chain, reflete with wooden parrots and brightly-colored tiles. Something about the inside of the building makes it very loud inside at lunchtime - not a spot to sit and bring a book and contemplate the mysteries of and the reality of your newly found adulthood...not that I've, you know, tried that...or anything...",,,,,,
-1,"So my bf and I wanted a drink and snacks since it was happy hour at 2 we went and we were in a bit of a hurry cause my bf had to go to work at 3 so it just turned 2 so we weren't really in a rush since we THOUGHT they would give us our meal in 5 min NOPE we pull up,press the red button it lights up......nothing we do it again...nothing. People next to is pulled up and ordered already. So we back out and go into another menu same thing waited about 2 min then they finally answered I asked is one of you menu broken? They said nope. So I told them what happens and we been waiting for 5-8 mins for someone to answer then they said o yeah one of the menus is broken. So I'm like alright and we ordered room about 15 min till our order came and that's when we were in a rush. Another time my bf ordered chili cheese fries they gave him what looked/tasted like plastic cold cheese fries and my strawberry limeade had way to many strawberry chunks in it I felt like I didn't even drunk anything mostly ate the strawberries and could really taste some syrup Idk it was too sweet!

1,"After spending time at IKEA and Linen N Things, we went mattress shopping. Not the most exciting piece of furniture in the house. Well, not until you get it home...wink, wink! The showroom is a sea of off white cushy rectangular sleeping slabs. Everything looks the same. Try this one. How 'bout this one. This, is our premier mattress. Really? My backside must be numb (insert joke here), cuz they all kinda felt the same. When the salesperson told me I was lying on a $2,200 mattress, I sprang from the bed as if I'd heard some clatter and got outta bed to see what was the matter. We settled on a less expensive version and have been peacefully sleeping ever since. Well. Except for my freight train snoring apparently. But I'll yelp about that later. The salesperson was a good sport as The Culinary Comedian and his fashion designer boyfriend were cracking up and cracking jokes as we lay, man to man, on beds all over the showroom. Plenty of eyes wandered our way when we attempted to spoon each other. You gotta test it out. That's what the salesperson said. Finally, after a day of spending thousands of dollars you get that final pre sign on the dot question. Mattress cover for $99? Uh, no. Thanks though. Well if you spill or tear it or a meteor lands on it, the warranty is null and void. Still,  no. But thank you. It also prevents bed bugs and bed mites. SOLD! You should have mentioned that first buster. Sleep America. Where Gay America (and you other people) Go To Sleep!",,,,,,

-1,Not many menu choices but we both ordered the chicken fried steak & could have shared one plate. We both had half our plates left over. That would have been nice to know ahead of time. The bread they serve before dinner is ok; it kept the kids occupied until the food came. The food we ordered was ok but I don't think we will be back. Slow waiter service as well.,,,,,,
-1,"While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.  \n\nWhen my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\n\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \n\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \n\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!",,,,,,
-1,"Really bland tasting food, and annoying atmosphere, as well as annoying staff. The food has nothing unique about it. I wish the fries were good so \""bottomless fries\"" meant something to me. The table we sat at was REALLY close to another table (there is a row of crammed tables) and the people next to us were eavesdropping the entire time. Quite uncomfortable, but the only seating available. They brought out an entirely wrong burger to me, but gave me a $20 giftcard since they messed up, so that was cool.",,,,,,
1,"Review in Haiku:\n\nOld folks congregate,\n\nin this dark, hole in the wall,\n\njukebox plays oldies.\n\nP.S.- I really like the Swizz.",,,,,,
-1,"I used to love Panera but as the years have gone by their standards of both food and service has declined greatly. It's a gamble if you are going to get good food and service or if the D team is working that day and they serve cold soup and sandwiches that look like Stevie Wonder  made them. I have to be deserate now to go there, like travelling on the Ohio turnpike and my other rest stop options are burger king and popeyes. Coprorate needs to improve and manage  their quality control,training, and processes. It's like they came out with a bang and now are just coasting.",,,,,,
1,Annie's Pet Parlor has always impressed us.  They are kind and gentle.  We plan ahead so paying with cash has never been a problem.,,,,,,
-1,"Just like the rest of downtown Phoenix, this place was dead. Our server was slow, taking 10 to 15 minutes to bring out our drinks. The food was okay, but nothing to write to my Yelp friends about. If you can find somewhere else in downtown PHX, I recommend you give it a try before ending up at this place.",,,,,,
-1,"I have really good food here in the past (try eggplant rolatini) and the local bread is fantastic. Tonight, however, was just awful. Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be \""homemade\"" but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn't take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn't repeated.",,,,,,
1,"Been using the Dutch Girls dry cleaning and sewing services for a few years now and they have never let me down!  Personal, professional and timely service every time!  Sure there is cheaper places to go, but if good service is what you need they are your girls!",,,,,,
-1,"Seriously the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Service is always slow. I'm currently sitting in the parking lot right now with about 4 other cars from the drive thru that are waiting for food. If I could read my receipt (printer must be low on ink), I'd call the corporate office and tell them to fire the whole place and start over.",,,,,,
-1,"$10 cover, no hats, and they steal your ID.  How is this garbage still in business???",,,,,,
1,"They make a decent pizza with ample toppings and a chewy crust. Better, their sauce is sweet!",,,,,,
-1,After paying to park at the weak excuse of a mall that this place is located in we figured we might as well at least try to get our parking moneys worth so we stopped in and ordered up a couple margaritas to ease the pain of being bamboozled. I've definitely had better drinks and I've definitely had worse. Can't speak for the food here but I definitely wouldn't be running back for happy hour or any other hour for that matter to throw one back.,,,,,,
1,"Nice airport.  Way too big.  I had to go from A27 to B27 to make my connection, and I had to book through the half-mile terminal a la OJ Simpson from the old Hertz commercials... leaping over luggage trucks, weaving my way through baby strollers, high-fiving the janitorial staff and heismanning the people from Southwest who wanted me to sign up for their credit card.  If you understood this analogy and remember this commercial, then you too, my friend, are getting old like me.",,,,,,
-1,"This Caterer entirely ruined my sisters wedding yesterday.  For a small 50 person wedding, the cost was ridiculous and even though they paid their bill in FULL months before the wedding, the caterer was still asking for money up until the day of the event.  The Basic Cake clause in the contract was not explained well.  The catering staff kept asking the family all night for a schedule of things even though it had been provided to them by the bride weeks earlier.  They even cut the cake before the bridal couple cut the cake and were serving it during the toast!  \n\nThe food was cold, the displays were well done although very sparse, there was no butter provided for the rolls, salt and pepper was not provided and when asked for, was told that having salt and pepper available would be an insult to the chef.\n\nThe staff was supposed to be at the hall at 2:30 PM and didn't show up until after the guests started arriving at 3:45 for a 4 PM wedding.\n\nShameful, shameful.  I will never use this caterer again nor will I recommend it to any of my clients or businesses I do business with.",,,,,,
-1,"Goon alert!\n\nFood was once again, not terrible, but not what I ordered. (What's with this? Nothing on the menu is complicated, why can't you deliver what was ordered?)\n\nHowever, when I tried to get the attention of my waiter I was accosted by a goon.\n\nThe guy tells me he is the manager, but he acted like a goon. Came up to the table, did not identify himself as being part of the establishment and growled \""Waddya want?\""  \n\nHe got angry and slammed away when I asked him who he was.\n\nThe waiter is a really nice guy and hampered by a kitchen that seems to never quite get it right. But where it is usually at least passable, the manager pushed them over to total failure.",,,,,,
1,I just wanted to give my two cent. I have been going to dawn studio for years. I like the fact that Dawn studio  is a small business phoenix az owned good for the economy..all of us. I like the classes I feel I get a great workout everytime. I do wish they had classes wtih the cool air..but then it would be call Hot Yoga..lol. I also would like to see more pilates classes. \nI met Dawn when she still had a regular job and a weight problem she has taught me more about staying focus working hard to getting in shape since she know what it take to keep it together. I would recommend Dawn classes in a heartbeat.!,,,,,,
1,"Great happy hour food and good drink specials. Try the Firecracker shrimp appetizer and Huckleberry Margarita, really good!!!\nGood idea after hiking Camelback mountain....\nFriendly, pleasant staff.",,,,,,
-1,"As a lifelong Pittsburgher, I've been to Tambellini's enough times over the years -- and I think it's still open simply because of it's location practically next door to the Benedum, and patrons who go there aren't the regular theater-goers.  I was invited to go with friends, who were old enough to remember when it was probably good.\nThe prices are *outrageously* high for the quality of the food and portions.  I had the Chicken Marsala, which was alright, but something I normally eat served out of a chafing dish at a funeral buffet. This was comparable to a catered version and the restaurant itself deserves a funeral... It's outdated and just a factory for getting people in and out and on time to the cultural events they're going to.\nThe waitress was nice enough, seemed a bit embarrassed to respond 'no' when I asked if certain menu items were fresh.  On the other hand, she disappeared quite a bit and didn't ask if we wanted any desserts -- which we probably would've if we'd been asked.\nEven though Downtown after business hours isn't the most exciting place to eat, there are other places I'll insist on going instead of back to Tambellini's.",,,,,,
-1,"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch.",,,,,,
-1,"I wish we could have met under better circumstances but the moment I walked into your establishment I wanted to vomit.  It reeked of sweaty gym socks and vinegar and there was no room at the bar.\n\nMaybe I will come back with \""What Odor?\"" in hand and we can have a fresh beginning.",,,,,,
1,The food is great & the service is even better.  \n\nI highly recommend this place.,,,,,,
-1,"Stopped for an early dinner with my wife,she wanted to try the two for twenty special.\nAs soon as we told the server what we wanted the service went downhill. We did not order any alcohol and we were having the special so this was not going to be a big check for the server but restaruant was not busy so any check should be better than no check.  Used the kiosk to pay for meal since i couldn't get the server to come back to check on us.Discount did not show up on kiosk I shouls have been  more aware since i had heard a similar comment from another table when we came in. Server said not to worry that the amount was correct. I pushed for reciept showing what was actually being charged to ny card. server said she needed my card and would have to talk to the manager. Finally got my paper reciept with correct charges but kiosk on table showed the over charge and had not adjusted. My wife thought we were going to be billed twice for the same meal, so she has been watching the debit card account.\nThis incident killed my night and the weekend with my wife constantly checking the bank account. This incident is all that my has been talking about to her friends all weekend long, I am sure that this will continue once she gets to work tomorrow.",,,,,,
1,"CPK catered our playgroup event, and what a terrific job they did!  Their people were charming and all the food was delicious, especially the linguine, the Thai chicken pizzas, and the wild field greens salad with candied nuts.",,,,,,
-1,"Definitely overpriced for what they offered.  Took my car in to check my AC, they didn't get back to me for the whole day, and decided to fix whatever the problem was without asking me and charging me an insane about (approximately $150 more than most places).  Definitely will not go back there again.",,,,,,
1,"This is the resort course for the Pointe Tapatio Cliffs Hilton.  \n\nNot an easy trek by any stretch of the imagination, but nevertheless a playable course for virtually anyone.  Desert golf is great in that low-index golfers can be challenged by the requirement to play target golf.  High handicap or newer golfers should enjoy the fact that the desert conditions make it very easy to find errantly hit balls and place them back in the fairway.  (Don't try to hit off the desert dirt unless you hate your clubs.)\n\nThere are a couple difficult forced carries but as long as you pick the correct tee box, they are all manageable.  Course conditions are always immaculate.  (I've probably played here 20 times over the past 5 years.)  The greens fees are a little on the high side, but then again this is resort golf and that is to be expected.\n\nMy only complaint is the service.  The guys who work the carts need to grow up and act a little more mature.  I get tired of standing there watching towel fights or two guys arguing over who can hit a golf ball farther.  I don't know why, but this seems to have gotten worse in the past year.",,,,,,
1,"Definitely a must-try! The building itself isn't much to look at but the parking lot is always full and that's a great indication of yummy-ness. It caters to both meat and veggie eaters with fake chicken, duck, and beef plates. They also have mock seafood plates as well. \n\nMy friend and I went to check this place out because we had heard so much about it. She ordered the lemon grass chicken and I tried the ginger duck. Both were so tasty and we were kinda freaked out because they tasted just like the real thing. The service was excellent and kudos for the waitress who kept filling up our waters...even AFTER we paid the bill. It's reasonably priced and the food portions are perfect. We even had leftovers.",,,,,,
-1,"The upstairs theater is nice enough. There are a few nice semi-upscale restaurants here. It's also got a really good swanky (and somewhat hidden) bar here. \n\nSo why only 2 stars? Well, because it smells like this is where all the diarrhea in the world goes to die... especially the parking structure. If you can escape the smell though, this is a nice spot for a date. The problem with that is when you go walk her to her car, you have to try and figure out how to have a good night kiss while your nose is telling your brain that you are swimming in a septic tank.\n\nThe new Waterfront mall corridor stinks like this as well. Maybe that's where the term \""filthy rich\"" comes from. What do these people eat?",,,,,,
-1,"If i could give China Chili less than one star, I would.\n\nFriends keep dragging me there because it is walking distance from their offices.  If they keep insisting on China Chili, i might have to show up too late to get lunch. I have never had a good meal there. The worst was mushu that tasted like the vegetables in it were canned.",,,,,,
-1,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I drove 40 minutes out of my way to have one of these great green chile burritos...I was at least expecting pulled beef, not beef squares.  The sauce was decent, had a good kick, but there was wayyy too much of it with no chips to eat it with? SHAME on them for no chips and salsa!!!!! For $8 there was very little amount of beef inside swimming in green chile sauce-How did they get all that green chile sauce to stay in there!? We ate it on the picnic tables outside in the 107 degree heat while we got bitten by ants.  It's a pretty sketchy neighborhood, so I would make this a lunch time experience if you must try it for yourself.  Come packin' some heat if you don't want to end up like 'boys in da hood' LOL",,,,,,
-1,"So, I don't know WHY we decided to stop into this sports bar for some lunch during our Charlotte trip, oh wait, yes I do remember. It's because we were starving to death and sick of walking in the 100 degree weather. \n\nAnyway, I still regret stopping in as I'm sure there are a million better places in the area to go. The service was terrible, granted we think the guy may have been new, but it was overall awkward and just odd. I don't really want a side of 'uncomfortable' with my mushroom swiss burger. (I also don't want to be asked what kind of cheese I want on my mushroom SWISS burger). \n\nPricing was a little high, food was decent, service was pretty bad but more than anything I'm just mad at myself that I didn't do a bit more research. Definitely should have found a local lunch gem that would have satisfied my appetite and need for a great cultural experience. There's always next time.",,,,,,
1,"I'd have to say this is one of my favorite airports to connect though.  I've never been delayed and the food selection during layovers is decent - I recommend the burrito place. I enjoy the free wifi a lot too.\n\nThere is a shuttle that goes to the metro that will take your downtown.  It's easy to use and cheap.  I highly recommend it.\n\nThat being said, when you are flying out of PHX - give yourself LOTS of time if you have a rental car to return.  Like 2 hours to park the car at the rental place, get on the shuttle, and get over to the terminal.  I didn't give myself enough time and missed the cut off for my flight by like ten minutes and wound up with a PHX-LAS-CLT-IND red eye instead of my PHX-IND flight that I was supposed to be on. i'm still bitter about it.",,,,,,
-1,"After reading the other reviews, my friend and I went to try this out wanting good Tex-Mex. I was surprised how mediocre it was. I had the enchiladas (my typical go-to dish at Tex-Mex restaurants) and just found them very ordinary. Even the margarita just wasn't that flavorful. After having some other Mexican that was outstanding places like Milagro Grill earlier in the week, this was not up to par.",,,,,,
-1,"This is nothing disparaging about the food. The food is quite tasty and exceptional. However, the service was less than stellar. I waited 10 minutes for my dessert and another 15-20 for my check, and my water was not refilled once. It was impossible to get anyone's attention to get service which is enough to put me off and not want to come back. Personally, I don't pay good money to wait on a server, I pay to get waited on. That may make me a snot but it's what I expect when I go to a restaurant.",,,,,,
1,"I haven't been to many airports in my life, so of the few that I've been to, Sky Harbor is one of the better ones. And here's why: outlet stations. If you have any kind of electronic device that sometimes acts as an extra appendage, you can appreciate the sight of a row of outlets in an airport. I can't tell you how many times I've arrived at the airport, realized my cell battery was low and panicked at the thought of my phone dying before take off and not having any buffer to airplane small talk.\n\nSky Harbor is clean and efficient with helpful signage as airport signage should be. I think I've always flown out of B or C gate and the food options are pretty good-better than your standard airport cuisine. Of course the prices are airport-appropriate (see: highway robbery), but should you be stuck there for an extended period of time, the eats won't be limited to mystery meat from the golden arches. Pretty much every restaurant I saw had a bar which is great for those of us with air travel anxiety. \n\nI don't mind stopping through Sky Harbor and should I get stuck there, I think it's one of the better airports to get stuck in.",,,,,,
1,"Fate is a great downtown spot. The servers are down-to-earth, the food is great, and best of all, it's open late! The lack of late-night joints in this city is horribly depressing.\n\nIt's sad to read other reviews of Fate being such an awful place. True, they do take reservations which can cause some trouble with people who just walk in. Those of you who complain about having to wait outside, look at what you are dining in - a house! It's not the most spacious restaurant and if it is busy, they certainly do not have room for people to crowd the place. If there is a long wait, again - a house! There are no more than a few tables. \n\nAs far as the service goes, it is excellent. The servers are extremely down-to-earth and knowledgable. The food is great, too - I recommend the Fried Tofu Wedges (well, the tofu in general), the Pad Thai, and the Hot and Sour soup. They also have fried rice, which is awesome with shrimp. \n\nAll in all Fate is a great place. Make reservations, grab a couple close friends, check out their awesome beer list, and you're guaranteed to have a great experience.",,,,,,
-1,Vanilla porter and root beer pretty tasty. Rest of the beers below par.  For the price food wasn't that great either. Wouldn't come back here again,,,,,,
-1,"Preferred Parking's rates are way too high.  We're parking in Charlotte, people, not San Francisco.  They actually want to charge me around $140/month to park in the lot near my building.  Are you kidding me?  That's what it cost to park in Chicago (and I used to work downtown).  I'm not sure if some people's companies subsidize their parking and that's why they are willing to support these crazy rates, but it just boggles my mind.  \n\nIn addition to their bad prices, their customer service is abysmal.  \nI used them for awhile when I first moved to Charlotte (parking far away from my workspace, so I could actually afford it).  But, abruptly, Preferred Parking sold the lot I parked in, never gave me any notice but did call me right before the transfer and rudely told me to find somewhere else to park.  More confusion ensued, and I ended up severing all ties with them and found another company's lot to park in. It's even further away, but worth it to no longer have to deal with Preferred Parking's bad prices and bad customer service.",,,,,,
-1,Decent price on domestic pitchers. Entrees were half off but all looked mediocre. Tried the jambalaya and it was so so. Big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service.,,,,,,

1,"My blackberry wouldn't charge due to a loose mini USB port. I had just 2 bars left for power and it's my only phone so sending it out was not an option. It was out of warranty and I don't carry insurance on my phone. I called Sun Cellar and he quoted me a price and a wait time of 20-25min. I looked around at other repair centers and found their quotes to be 2x as much and they didn't have a tech in until the afternoon and told me it would take an hour or more.\n\nI got there and was helped right away. The repair took 10minutes (if that!). Dan was polite, pleasant, and very knowledgeable. The cost was exactly the price he quoted me on the phone. I am so grateful that he was able to help me out. The repair cost less than my deductible would have cost with insurance, certainly a fraction of what a new phone cost, and he had me operational in 10 minutes! I couldn't ask for better service!\n\nI would certainly recommend this business to anyone needing cell phone repair and will use them again!",,,,,,
1,"I was surprised at how good the food was at this tiny place. I normally avoid the \""hole-in-the-wall\"" type places, but I decided to give this one a try and SO happy I did. The food was well priced and not too greasy. The ingredients taste fresh and it has that family owned feeling.",,,,,,
1,I sat at the outdoor bar under a straw rooftop and the March breeze cooled down the Phoenix 90-degree March heat and I truly felt like I was in Hawaii. The margaritas were S-T-R-O-N-G and the crowd was lively and fun!,,,,,,

1,C section was very empty when we fly out on a Monday night. Security lined moved quickly and it's a pretty clean airport. The water from the filter water refill station tasted salty and gross though.,,,,,,
1,"I love family owned restaurants and will gladly try any place that isn't a franchise.  I was very surprised to go in on a Saturday morning and the place was bustling with activity and lots of diners, all of whom looked to be regulars and quite happy with their morning blintz or eggs.  I ordered a pumperdine bagel with lox, cream cheese and onions and it was top notch and piled high with lox.  Delicious.  Love the deli pickles, very authentic, not your normal over vinegared store brand.  \n\nI would love to go back soon, after seeing their list of smoked fish...I love a good deli with fish choices and I can't wait to also try a corned beef sandwich.",,,,,,
1,"Tucked away into an old central (and scary) neighbourhood, it was a bit hard  to find in the dark. Glad we did, though!\nGot a lemonade (made with fresh lemon juice), the fried chicken with cheese biscuit sandwich and split an order of bacon cheddar fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy outer breading, thick and juicy meat inside. The biscuit was really tasty and flaky. It came with a few cubes of watermelon but I don't like melon so those went untouched. \nWe sat inside at the bar and everyone working inside was super nice and friendly. They have quite a few regulars and I could see why. The prices were a bit higher than I expected but they use totally local sourced ingredients and everything is prepared fresh so you're paying for the quality just as much as the quantity. \nAn order of cheddar bacon fries, a biscuit chicken sandwich with watermelon side, lemonade, and tip totalled to just over $21.",,,,,,
1,"After three visits I am hooked! Great little place. I tried this place because of a local dines deal and now keep going back. Two time everything was 100% perfect. This last time the bread on my meatball sub was just a little hard, actually really hard but the meatballs are so good that I overlooked it! I have had the lasagna which was very flavorful and lots of cheese and sauce. The appetizers are great as well as the pasta fagiolli. The canolli is a great choice for dessert. Service is always friendly and fast. Food hot and fresh. The place is small but worth the wait. The owner was asking everyone how their meals were. Nice to see him involved and taking care of customers.",,,,,,

1,Great food. I have never been disappointed.,,,,,,
-1,"We love Greek food and have eaten it all over the world - including Greece....  This wasn't all that impressive.  First clue should have been that the place was virtually empty on a Saturday night....  Calamari was mediocre - definitely had much better elsewhere.  We can make Tzatziki that is equivalent or better in quality.  Moussaka was a huge disappointment - dry, undercooked eggplant...  Best dish was marinated swordfish - but definitely not worth $18...",,,,,,
1,"One of the only pizza places I get really excited to visit. It has a lot of Italian-American food...calzones, lasagna, strombolis, and they're all freaking delicious.\n\nMy favorite is the mouthwatering double-deckeroni pizza. Double pepperoni, a spicy pizza sauce, and an awesome cheese blend that sends my taste buds straight to heaven, arteries be damned. For the purists out there: Yes, we know it's not *really* Chicago style, but who cares when it's this tasty? You can always get the thin crust.\n\nThey also have an extensive beer selection. They boast 110 brews, and you can take a \""world tour\"" of beer. Basically, you can record every drink you order on a membership card, and when that's done, you get your very own witty one-liner on a plaque in the waiting area. Really cool concept, but I offer some criticisms--too many of the beers are stuff we've already had. Do I really have to drink one more of the same domestic drafts to make it? What a chore. There's another list for the various martinis they have, but unfortunately those are hit or miss.\n\nThis is a great place to stuff your face, get a nice buzz, and watch the game. Shout out to the waitress that introduced me to Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. She gave this review just enough of a boost to give it four stars.",,,,,,
-1,"Prepare to be wowed. \n\nHigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \""Gar\u00e7on\"" I asked, \""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence.",,,,,,
-1,"Okay, I have lived in Phoenix and in LA. I have always thought LA was more expensive until my experience at Maroney's Cleaners. Holy Crap Ohla!!! I paid $7.65 for a pair of lined pants to get cleaned by them. Now, I have paid anywhere from $1.50 to $5.50 but are you kidding me $7.65. Then to top it off...I was a bit disappointed in the actual dry cleaning service because my pants were not perfect!!! So, after I was done throwing a temper-tantrum in the tahoe I then proceeded to call and text everyone I know (okay just kidding) about my frustrations. The drive up service is convenient however the price is NOT WORTH IT!!!",,,,,,
-1,"I have traveled all over this wonderful country and stayed in many hotels.  This easily ranks among the worst.  The staff is rude, the room has a weird stench if the AC is not on, and the \""breakfast buffet\"" in the morning is a regimented affair with coffee canisters empty or spitting some weird, vaguely brown, lukewarm liquid. The staff will thrust a bag with unidentified contents at you if you do not wish to stay in the dirty, cluttered eating area, and tell you this is what you are \""allowed\"" to take.  \n\nClearly this establishment benefits mightily from its location, so if there is a hotelier out there reading this I suggest you look into Madison as a likely place to put a comfortable inn.  I am sure I am not the only one who would take advantage of such a alternative.",,,,,,
-1,"I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood.",,,,,,
-1,"We have dined at this chain for over 20 years. It was one of our favorites. Well bubba, those days are long gone. Ate at the one nearest us in Savannah and noticed the flavor and quality of my dinner (Pasta Rustica) was not up to par. Server said the new owners are all about the bottom line and are changing the recipes. Hello new owners; this is a recipe for disaster. \""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"" \n\nDecided to give them one more shot. Big mistake pigboy! The Carbonna was horrible, and that is as kind as I can get. Do they have a corporate taste kitchen? It was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat. A poached egg on top? Not the way to do it. Egg is an integral part of the recipe, not an add-on to pretend this is breakfast too. I tried to eat it but simply could not; even after dousing it with olive oil. There was no sauce; no moisture. Besides, the egg pasta was too thick. \n\nServer did a good job. I asked to speak to the manager. She was gracious and, to her credit, comped my dinner and gave us a free desert. Class act. \n\nBut that was the last time. If you have patronized this place over the years before it was sold, you can now forget them. Do not waste your money.",,,,,,
-1,"This was awful.  Base on the reviews from this site we decided to check it out.  I reallly wanted to like it, it's close to home, has awesome architecture, great outside seating and good atmosphere.  Howerver that's when the good times stopped.  The chips showed up and were so stale they had to have been out of the bag since early last week.  The salsa was not tasty at all and the sour cream came in cafeteria packets or \""in baked potato packets from Golden Corrall\"" as Jessie says.\n\nWhen the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips.  Jessie will eat just about any Mexican food on the planet but this was TERRIBLE.  I haven't a clue what other people enjoyed, maybe we managed t order the two things on the menu that are awful.\n\nTo top it all off there weren't any entertaining people in the whole place to pay attention to.  Just unacceptable.  \n\nNeedless to say we will not be visiting the Fiesta Cafe again, unless there is a Fiesta with lots of free booze.",,,,,,

-1,"I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today, half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entr\u00e9e too, but at least it was edible.)\n\nI finally think I'm done with this place.",,,,,,
-1,"Recently purchased a car here. Thought it would be decent, due to average reviews and featured on an app I downloaded for recommended dealers. By far not the best experience. They will tell you what you want to hear during the dealing process, and then make all sorts of excuses not to follow through with promises. \n\nHave had issues with the car, drivers window quit working, so they told us to let the guy who was replacing the windshield know. We did, the guy fixed it, we were on our way. \n\nCame time to make our first payment, which they told us wasn't due for another two weeks, and then a few days later was supposedly due and late, and informed us that we owe them now for the drivers side window. And since we were late, it \""threw up red flags\"" for them. Really?! So not coming through on your cheap little 500 mile warranty didn't throw up \""red flags\"" for us as consumers? Whatever.  \n\nThese people are very shady. Do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you. They are money sharks and will not help you whatsoever in good faith. Shop around and stay away from them. The only reason we didn't give the car back is the 1000 dollars we had already paid. We are just going to go to our regular mechanic now, and deal with them as less as possible.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, the car blew a head gasket a month after we bought it. They want $2600 to fix it, and will not do anything in good faith. Waste of a lot of money $1700 to be exact (down payment, first month worth of payments and all the towing)... Words of advise...STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. There are way better dealers in the valley that will help you. We now have to save up for another down payment for a different car. They can eat s**t.",,,,,,

-1,"I was very specific when I made my reservations several months ago. I needed a non-entrance level room away from noise. We were given a room right off of the hotel Foyer. It is mid-night and a party rages just outside my door even though I have called the front desk asking for their assistance. Right now I would prefer to be in a Motel6.  This room was relatively not cheap, it should have at least been cut-rate given out only as a last resort.  The next time I am in Pittsburgh it will not include a stay at The Priory, which is a shame because besides this issue it is a nice place. But if you are considering staying at this hotel why take the chance. While the party continues and I am getting no help from the front desk I am tempted to lower my rating to a single star. But, hey, I can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night.",,,,,,
-1,"This is just an average place. Its not bad. \nParking is free, small lot but street parking around the area is possible.\nWent there for brunch. \nHippy looking teenage waitress was patronizing, Couldn't serve me a side of bacon with my Bloody Mary before my entree for whatever reason. \nBiscuit was dry, really nothing special. \nSalmon hash was average and not very many salmon pieces, mostly potatoes and onion. It was tasty none the less. Quantity was less than average. \nBacon was just like what they serve at my hospital cafeteria, nothing special. \nThere was a 25 minute wait which is always expected at a good brunch place. \nBloody Mary was average as well. \n\nWhen I think of brunch I expect a quantity and quality as I am combining both meals. Here Quantity was slightly less than average, and quality was average. \n\n\n\nNoise level- Noisy, \n\nThey take cards including AMEX\n\nHave no idea why this place is so popular. Probably people haven't been to Original pancake house, much better service and far better food and cheaper too (they take only cash)",,,,,,
-1,"I've had better burgers at several other Pittsburgh restaurants. I have never eaten anything else on the Tessaro menu--and since it doesn't look very appealing, it's not likely that I will--but the burgers are just OK. The service, in my opinion, is often quite rude. The \""ambiance\"" is loud, dark, dingy and depressing. Sorry, but I just don't get it. For a better hamburger, try the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium, Murray Avenue Grill, or even Five Guys Burgers and Fries.",,,,,,
-1,"I used to frequent Le Peep. It's reliable food, but nothing great or special. The food doesn't have too much flavor to it, and if you get over that, it's decent.\n\nThe last time I went, I only wanted to go because I had a free meal to redeem from the punch cards they have. Now, I had two different cards with punches that both added up to a full card. You would think that they could add those two cards together to redeem my meal. However, when I was at the stand to redeem the card, the host wouldn't let me because the punches were on two separate cards. She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said \""SEE ID.\"" So, she asked me, \""Do you want me to look at your ID?\"" I answered no. She asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid. I'm pretty sure that asking that question defeats the purpose of writing that in the signature line. I'm not one to even care if people check my ID, but phrasing a question like that just showed the ignorance of the employees at this restaurant.\n\nThe servers have always been nice, it's just the hosts (and manager I believe) that were incredibly disappointing. I won't be returning.",,,,,,

-1,"Well, it does get one from point A to point B in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut it's expensive, at least compared to the Metro Transit in Minneapolis that I'm used to. On Port Authority, it's $2.25 for a ticket, and an extra $1 for a transfer (which only gets you on one more bus, not all the way to your destination if it requires a bunch of transfers.) Coming from a maximum of $3 for two and a half hours of bus rides (express bus during rush hour), Port Authority is steep. I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.\n\nThere's no day pass. Boo. If you're traveling a lot throughout the day, it adds up fast without some sort of pass.\n\nAlso, the 28X doesn't pick up passengers coming from downtown into Oakland (or drop them off in the reverse direction.) Very frustrating, especially with a Megabus terminal only three blocks away from one of the stops. (There's also Greyhound and Amtrak downtown, if I remember correctly.)",,,,,,
1,"This isn't your average shaved ice place. It is AMAZING. My favorite summer treat and it makes great leftovers too! There's so many flavor options and you're always met with friendly staff. They even have options for people who are sugar free which is great. The ice is shaved super finely, unlike anywhere else. It's kind of like eating flavored freshly fallen snow. It can be enjoyed any time of the year, but it is particularly good after a day in the heat. I recommend wedding cake Bahama Rama mama with creme!",,,,,,

-1,"I should preface this by saying this wasn't my pick, and not really my kind of place.  That being said, it's a decent conventional style restaurant and not bad for what it is. \n\nI had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy.  The boiled red skinned potatoes were pretty much what you'd expect boiled red skinned potatoes to be, and they come with melted butter on the side in case you'd really like to pack an artery.  This is definitely not a meal for anyone worried about TMAO.\n\nI don't want to be too hard on the place because, you know, it is what it is, and for what it is, it's not that bad, not that good, just ok; something like that.  \n\nNow, I just wonder how long that burger is going to remain in my gut.

-1,"We just went here last night because of charlotte restaurant week and wanting to try a different upscale restaurant.  The experience was nothing close to nice or upscale.  We arrived and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess, A+ to the hostesses.\n\nIt took some minutes before our waiter came to us, friendly, but slow.  Kevin and I both ordered our appetizers, meal, and dessert all at once, along with a drink from the bar.  Kevin ordered soup and I ordered a salad.  Kevins soup came, no salad for me.  The server came by with bread and did not say a thing.  My salad finally arrives.  A few minutes later the server returns and mentions she is glad to see that I have my salad now and was wondering what happened to it.  Both the soup and the salad were good, but to eat starters separately should not happen.  After finishing, I finally get my bar drink, the server appologizes for it taking so long.\n\nNext to courses.  Kevin had lobster pasta and I had steak.  My steak was dropped off, but no steak knife was dropped off by our waiter, the person who dropped off the food, or anyone.  Waiter no where in sight, I flag down someone for a steak knife.  Aside from that, the steak was good, had a nice flavor.  Kevin liked his, but did not think it was anything special.\n\nWe finish the main course and are waiting around for some time, our waiter comes by and asks us if we want boxes, we say yes.  A couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts. He asked us of we were still working on our dinners, suprised to see them on the table.  We told him we were waiting on boxes.  He takes them away to box them.  A few minutes later our waiter comes with boxes, and is surprised to see our food gone.  Aside from that, the desserts were good.  The chocolate cake was rich, but great!\n\nOverall, I was not blown away by the food, and since the service and experience was awful, I will not be back.  If I'm going to pay a lot of money for dinner, it should all be great.  It was just like going to a mediocre restaurant, felt nothing like an upscale restaurant.",,,,,,
-1,"I stayed here with my fiance for a night a couple of Saturdays ago.  Upon entering the hotel we noticed that they had won a single diamond star 2010 and my fiance followed up with that by asking what has happened since then.  The lobby of the hotel seemed to be pretty nice and check in was quick and easy.  Our room was on the second floor and upon entering I was surprised at how small it was.  It reminded me of hotels over in Europe and barely had room to move around in.  We weren't planning on spending much time in the room and so I didn't pay much attention to it.  I guess that I should have paid more attention to the name of the hotel though as that could have been a clue.  As we were leaving the room and headed toward the elevator we noticed a vending machine that was probably 90% empty.  Odd but it seemed to fit with the rest of the dingy decor of the place.  After we got back to the place and my fiance climbed onto the bed it immediately sunk down pretty far.  Not a good thing.  In the morning we ended up checking out early and skipping the free breakfast as we were happy to get out of there.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't stay here again in the future.  Yes, this place is cheap but I would rather pay the extra money and stay somewhere else that feels cleaner and has some more room.",,,,,,
-1,"Was driving by Madison and thought we'd get some BBQ.  I had the spicy chicken, which was just a chicken breast on a bun, with sauce on the side.  That was it, not even a big chicken breast? \n\nMy wife had the turkey sandwich, which didn't appear to be anything special either.  It looked like it was from a grocery store.\n\nKids liked the burger and brats.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the prices, sandwich platters were $8.45 each and drinks were $1.99 each.  Wasted my money on these as they don't give you a drink you can take with you and it's a plastic cup.  \n\nWhat I did like was the sides, except for the one order of fried biscuit, which was raw in the middle.  Threw them out.\n\nLast, I've never been to a BBQ place with no sauces on the table and only one served with the order.  I liked the sauce, but with all of the awards on the wall, they should offer a few options. \n\nShould have gotten the pulled pork.",,,,,,
1,"Went here because it was the only place I could find listed on Yelp. \nDemitialia's recent experience was on target. \n\nMy Jean d'Eve had stopped working while in storage and I took it in to get the battery changed.

He removed the battery and the corrosion, blew the crud out of the watch with canned air, oiled the works, replaced the battery closed it up, and set the time. $5.00.\n\nI asked about a new band. \""Lizzard or Crocodile? Maybe plain?\"" He had a very nice selection of bands in various styles. I chose a crocodile. He threw in new spindles, no charge. $20.\n\nWe began talking about New York. Turns out he worked on 47th Street (the Diamond District). We traded a few stories about living in NYC. Nice guy.\n\nHe looked down and noticed that the Jean d'Eve had lost time. Took the whole thing apart again. More air. More oil. \""Bring it back if it acts up.\""\n\nTwo hours later. I'm back. He replaces the circuit board. No Charge. More air. More oil. \""Looks like the corrosion may have gotten into the works... but let's see.\"" Tells me if the watch continues to loose time, he'll have to operate.  \n\nFive hours later, the watch seems to be keeping time.

-1,"We drove to the LoLo's downtown location from basically the 51 and Shea to find that it closed at 7. From there, we drove up Grand to Town Talk II, which sadly, also closed at 7. We had a chat with the owner who told us that the closest place for barbecue was Honey Bear's, even though he said that he didn't want to see us leave.\nIt was about a 5 minute drive from there. Once we arrived, we ordered. I got the ribs and two nasty side items that came with it. The fountain drink machine didn't have Coke or Pepsi products, but had R-C Cola products. The selection was interesting, but I found it unique and somewhat cool.\nAnyway, my plate had six or seven ribs drenched in a too-sweet barbecue sauce. The ribs had almost no meat on them.\nI don't know, maybe I asked for the wrong food or something, but I was highly disappointed in Honey Bear's. I do admit, however, that the televisions showing the NBA Finals did help a bit. I don't think I'll come back. I've also learned a valuable lesson: for the most part, restaurants in Downtown Phoenix close at 7.",,,,,,
-1,"I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \""mistake\"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.",,,,,,

-1,"Nice people, but when you take in 3 pairs of $150 jeans to have them shortened and they say yes we can keep the original hem apparently they think that means to cut off the original hem and stitch the alteration as close to they originally looked as possible. Everywhere else in the world that's called matching the stitch (which is usually cheaper) but not keeping the hem. Two totally different things and matching stitching isn't worth $10 per alteration. One last thing, they didn't even match the thread color and width well. Original is a faded yellow and they used a shiny bright yellow. Looks totally sloppy.\n\nThey refused a refund and said they would fix it at the same price with the actual hem... If we went through a box of a ton of alterations scraps and matched it. Total scam artists. Too bad cash was paid or they would be getting a challenge from my credit card. \n\nI found them by yelp and hopefully other people consider this review before giving these dishonest business people any money.",,,,,,

Even when given the pass of a misunderstanding, the manager (owerners daughter as she so often identify herself) was more interested in making HER point than making sure out of state customers who went out of their way to visit the establishment....and checked-in on Facebook have an enjoyable experience.

1,"Pretty good Korean food.... IMO.\n\nI lived in Korea Town, Los Angeles for a few years and would walk to our local souju spots and our local Korean BBQ spots with great frequency, so I ate a lot of Korean food.  This place is about as good as the Hodori in Los Angeles, which I would rate 3 stars, but this place gets 4 being in the middle of the desert with little else to compare.  Hodori, LA is literally surrounded by 100 other KBBQ spots.\n\nAnyway, service is whatever..... nothing special, which is to be expected at a Korean establishment.  Sides are pretty good and they are good about refilling them.\n\nTwo of us usually share one bbq dish and are perfectly full at the end after devouring the meal with all the sides.

On the second day, I also got two co-workers to eat there, and I think this is quickly becoming a Croque office.\n\nI've now had a number of their sandwiches, including their bugolki sandwich (on multi-grain with the garlic spread) and the chicken pesto club (on white with their remoulade) and both are absolutely delicious. Very different sandwiches, but each is great in its own right. Unwrapping these sandwiches alone is enough to get you salivating. The scent is irresistible! Add fresh, quality ingredients hand assembled while you wait, and you've got a winner. I was even eating some of the remoulade straight out of the side container they gave me, that's how good this stuff is!\n\nI also tried out their teriyaki chicken lunch bowl... YUM!\n\nMatter of fact, I'm getting hungry again just writing this...",,,,,,
-1,"Until recently I have been a long time patron of what may have been the finest Chinese eating establishment in Arizona. There were many memories made here. I moved away several years ago which made it difficult to get back to one of my all time favorite restaurants. Recently between appointments I found myself at lunch time both hungry and near this landmark. I was unaware of the ownership change until I walked in and was not greeted by familiar or friendly service. \n\nSince I was on limited time I ordered from the lunch menu expecting the the same service as I had been accustomed. Wrong. The order was taken in reasonable time but the food arrived luke warm almost 35 minutes later as I was preparing to leave. The lunch special wasn't very special and bordered on disgusting. Running late for my appointment, I had to track down staff so that I could get a guest check and pay my bill. I can say that both service and food quality were consistent: SUB PAR. It is unlikely I will return.",,,,,,
1,"My husband and I went here to create our baby shower registery a few months back and were pleasantly suprised by how easy they make it for you. The woman at the desk was very friendly and helpful. This is our first child so we had no idea what we were doing! After being signed up, we were provided with a scanner, a map of the store and a checklist for must have items. The store is set up in lettered sections which makes it easy to find what you're looking for in such a large store. There is always a staff member around the corner that is eager to answer any questions you may have. \nThey also made it very easy to return things that we received, even without a receipt! They just loaded the value onto a gift card. Also, if you make your registry here... after your shower they will give you 15% off everything that is still on your registry!  They also have a great rewards program and you get coupons printed on your receipt every time you shop here!\nThe reason I give 4 stars is because they are a little pricey...",,,,,,
1,"Eastwind is back in my good graces. The whole fried rice thing was fixed. You can now order half portions of their delicious fried rice, including veggie fried rice! Which leaves room for all their other delectable morsels.\n\nAnd they have liquor now! Woohoo! I had already ordered my sake bomber before I read that on the menu so I didn't get a chance to order a cocktail. They should create a cocktail menu and throw some cocktail specials on their happy hour menu. (Hint, hint).\n\nA few changes to their menu and food, but all good ones! Still great service as well.",,,,,,
-1,"When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place.",,,,,,
-1,AWFUL!! i booked a hotel room here for New Years Eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room! 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before I was staying there my credit card was charged for the room!  I was treated like an idiot by Carmen who answered the phone.  She kept saying that I should have known but I would not have been so upset if I had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted!!  Make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room!!  Would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way I have been treated!!!,,,,,,
-1,"The associates are slow and rude. One time I ordered a bacon ranch salad with ranch dressing, got home, they gave me some north western I don't even know what it was crap. Go back ask politely for a packet of salad ranch dressing, because \""you gave me the wrong one I requested\"". She says \""what kind of dressing did we give you?\"" I said \""ma'am idk it was not ranch though\"" so she tries to give me ranch dipping sauce and the manager finally hands me the dressing I want. I just felt like I was being questioned. I do not need free packets of dressing, but I do want the kind I ordered. On several occasions before and after this incident I have experienced slow service, incorrect orders given to me, and extremely poor customer service. They should have people with some decency working there. I know it's McDonalds but as Si would say, good-NESS!",,,,,,
-1,This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.,,,,,,

1,"New in town, I had heard nothing but good things about Mama Java's, so since I live half a mile up 36th, I decided to walk down and try it for myself. I walked in and was immediately introduced to a warm, welcoming atmosphere. A very popular place, there were many people, and there was still ample seating. As I approached the counter, I had asked a friendly employee what they would recommend. As soon as she had asked if I liked chocolate, I quickly nodded in confirmation. I didn't have to wait very long for preparation of my soy mocha, which tasted truly outstanding. I highly recommend Mama Java's Coffee House, it's very well worth the price...SO much better than commercially owned coffee houses like Starbucks.",,,,,,

-1,"On name alone we HAD to check this place out, just for kicks.\n\nOuch!\n\nBandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way. And you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measure.\n\nI've got no qualms with talent, don't get me wrong; the female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form. A woman is a woman is a beautiful woman, and I'm a sucker. By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.\n\nThe squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under a tacky illuminated \""Bandaids Show Lounge\"" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with \""damn, I'mma get mugged out here\"" uncertainty and darkness.\n\nOnce inside (yes, you go in through a sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar while another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat down - *sub-standard: the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed \""no sideways caps, no baggy/saggy jeans, no long tees\"" dress code posted by the door should have been a red flag. Classy!\n\nAfter getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really, really good-looking - hottest girl on staff, setting false precedent for what the stage talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next to, the center stage.\n\nMost of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, mostly empty on a Friday night...\n... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way.\n... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, more amply-bossomed strippers.\n... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.\n\nGirl after girl (a couple of \""a'ight\"" girls, most \""everyday\"" girls, and at least one \""is that a girl?\"" girls) came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music - some exhibiting-gymnast calibre pole skills and limberness - then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection \""...would you like a dance?  ...would you like a dance?\"" propositioning. Sales Basics 101: Always Be Closing, right?\n\nNone of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbie-esque dancers who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.\n\nAfter a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of \""meh\"" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it...\n...the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire...\n...the summation of the Bandaids experience...\n...that's when we saw it... \n\n...The HOOD-KINI*!\n\nIt was time to leave... quickly. As we braved the parking lot,  it was joke after FirstAid-alluding and Infectious-disease related joke. Automatic hilarity at the mere mention during the rest of our trip.\n\n\""Band-Aids\"", because correlating \""possibility of infection\"" and adult entertainment is savvy business sense.\n____________________\nYes, yes.

This is a very common problem and I know they're not contractually obligated to buy my size, but I would spend $40 on a dress they bought for $2 from Goodwill if they had it!\nTheir organization.

-1,"My mom wanted to go here for lunch last Friday & I was actually kinda excited, because it's been a few years since I last came here. Parking was a bitch & that was a task in itself! Any way, we made our way back to the hostess stand & was told there would be a 30 minute wait. For lunch, really?! We decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait. \n\nLindsey was our server & she was so sweet, checked on us often too. For starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip. I forgot how big the portions are, what were we thinking ordering 2 apps?! The boom dip was yummy but the calamari was just ok, way too much breading/coating! For our entree we decided to split the 14\"" aunt margherita pizza (thin crust) & added artichokes. My mom only had a bite since she ate a lot of the apps, I had a slice & it was ok. Pretty bland in flavor, barely any cheese & the crust had a similar texture to cardboard. I took the leftovers home & my hubby agreed, he wasn't diggin the pizza either. \n\nTotal (not including tip) was about $40. While the food was just ok the service was great! I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years, because I know I've had good food here in the past. I think next time I need to order some pasta & definitely the pizza cookie!",,,,,,

-1,"This place is way overrated!!! They let ur car sit for 5-10 minutes before they even start to dry it.  By this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time.  Their armor all has gone down as well.  They used to have the best tire gloss that would last for 10 days, now they use a cheaper brand that's dull.  This place has really gone down over the years.  Again, way overrated.  30 second vacuum pfffff",,,,,,
1,"I went down to Phoenix for Spring Training and ran across this place in the middle of no where.   Waffle in the name of the joint and I love breakfast food so why not?\n\nWent in there first thing I saw was a Lamborghini outside the Waffle House, and my friends claimed they just saw Amare going into it.  I was too slow to confirm this nor could i get a camera out so oh wells, but if rich people will eat here, why not an average joe like me?\n\nThe place is a bit small, I wouldn't bring a group of 5 or more since none of the table can be together.   The wait wasn't horribly long, about 5-10 mins.  When we sat down the waitress was prompt with the menu and gave us some time to order which is rare in a quick serving food joint that's packed.\n\nI got the Special which consist of a giant waffle, 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and 3 bacon/sausages for 8 bucks.   You order this with the warm syrup and bam instant gratification.    \n\n1 star for the food, 1 for the service, 1 for cleanliness (for a diner setting), 1 ease of parking/location",,,,,,

1,Def one of the better if  not my best of the East Valley. The owners are very welcoming and its a nice quiet place. I'm a huge fan of fried rice and sweet and sour and they do both very well.

1,"Don't let the seedy location fool ya, this place is the bomb, serving up some of the most authentic Mexican I've ever tasted.\n\nYour experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.\n\nAs you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. \nThis should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. \n\nTheir chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.\n\nEvery item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. \n\nWhat I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. \n\nHere's my suggestion.\nGo on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.\n\nThe food, ambiance, service are all superb. \nThis is the place where I take out-of towner's when they say they want 'real' Mexican food. \nThis is also the place where your butt-hole will curse you the next day if you don't listen to him and ease up on the salsa.",,,,,,
-1,"Went here because of Man vs Food.  Nice place to have a Beer and watch sports or just hang out.  But, the food, that is another story.  My daughter had the fish tacos.  They where like Libby TV dinner style fish sticks no taste.  My wife had the Cheeseburger, again no taste and not any better that a Bob's Big boy burger.  I had the hot wings, they where OK, and the nachos where like High school football game nachos.  Our waitress always acted like she was being bothered.  All in All, I tried this place for food and I will not be going back or recommend to anyone I know.  Drinks only OK!!!  2 words describes this place:  Tourist Trap.",,,,,,
1,"I have to say it's a relief to not have to head south for some good espresso but this may be too far north...not sure. Their espresso is locally roasted and smooth so they automatically go into my top five. I also like the fact that the crowd is decidedly not the coffee snob crowd you'll find in venues further south. That being said, on my first visit the crowd was more the Sunnyslope crowd so I didn't know what to make of everything.\n\nAll that said, the coffee is good and I really liked the choices on their menu and they are all about local business. If I can come here and get a good Americano without having to wait in a long line I think I'm sold!",,,,,,
-1,"Is there a way to give zero stars?? \nI was waiting in a long line for a taxi home from Phx Sky Harbor. When I finally was given a cab I asked if they took credit. The cab driver said if he had to he could but asked if I would be willing to go to an ATM for cash. I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.\n\nOkay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. \n\nI sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. \n\nWhen I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.\n\nAbout an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the \""story\"". That if I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy that I would have to contact the police. \n\nAbsolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable. I cannot believe any business can successfully run like this. I will go out of my way to never use them again.",,,,,,

1,Ive been going here over the years. \n\nThe food is always spot on. I can't think of a visit where I left dissatisfied. \n\nI love that I can order Italian or Asian or a little bit of both. \n\nLast night I ordered the Orange Zest chicken and hubs got the seafood Au gratin. Both were fresh and very tasty. We also had the spicy shrimp lettuce wraps to start.They are spicy but have a great flavor. \n\nI must echo the other reviewers about the service. GOOD LORD. Seriously slowest.service.ever. Last night we waited a good 15 minutes for our server to come back with the bill and the hubs credit card. Not cool. We've decided that when we go next time to ask for our bill the second our food comes out.,,,,,,
1,"First of all I'm a regular here, coming in at least once a week for lunch. In other words, I LOVE this place!  Great food, wide variety, weekly specials, and a frequent diner card. \n\nThe servers are super friendly and know their shi....stuff :) Virginia and Amy are awesome. \n\nTomato soup - hands down the BEST I have ever had. Slightly sweet and very creamy. WOW. Serious mouthgasm. \n\nSmothered chicken - excellent gravy. I have had this one more times than I can count. Corn can be a little dry but you can always substitute a different side. \n\nFried pickles - these are spears, not slices, but the breading has great flavor and is very crisp. \n\nQuesadillas and burgers are good, fairly standard but still tasty. \n\nAll of their pastas are excellent. Can't go wrong here. \n\n\nWas not a fan of the meatloaf sandwich but the actual meatloaf dinner is well done. This sandwich is the only thing I ever ordered here that left me at all disappointed and I've probably stuffed my face with 3/4 of the stuff on the menu by now. \n\nOverall, their food has a home cooked, fresh flavor. Nothing tastes likes a tv dinner and for a sports bar, it goes above and beyond what I would expect for food. \n\nLove you Dillo, see you soon!",,,,,,
1,This is a great shop to find the sexi Billet items for your ride. Purchased an Polished serpentine set up for my SBC and some other dress up items and billet interior parts. Great selection and knowledgable staff. A little over priced for certain things so do your do-diligence and compare prices.,,,,,,
1,"I don't give five stars often, but here's my rationale. Their margaritas rock! It's the only place that you get your money's worth when you order a margarita. They are huge! They have a good variety of cool flavors to try too. Love it. But that's not it. They have the best green chili around, and it is HOT! I love hot spicy food, and this does not disappoint. Lastly, the chips and salsa service is good. I love the bean dip and the two types of salsa provided. i could just sit there and eat that alone. \n\nService is usually good. I normally just cruise in and sit at the bar. Can't wrong with service with the bartender standing in front of you the whole time. :)",,,,,,

In the lobby and my sleeping room I get free internet but when I walk in the conference room they want to rob me of $50.00. The workers were embarrased to tell me this and when I asked to speak to someone in charge they told me the managers will not discuss it. \n\nIf that is not enough they jab me for another $2.65 for a cup of coffee to include a refill. \n\nI don't care how nice the place is (and it is nice) I will not come back.,,,,,,

The prices have gone up the quality is shameful.\n\nI think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it.  Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again.\n\nNot sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken.

1,"There's an Autograph wall in the bar at this particular Hard Rock Cafe. For some reason, the only band I remember seeing was Sugar Ray. Wow. Go Phoenix! Way to bring in the big boys!\n\nReally though, it's a typical Hard Rock. The beer selection was fine, the tables were sturdy, and all the Rock n Roll memorabilia hanging from the walls were able to bring in the post-game crowd. It also shielded us from the crazy summer storm that was building up outside. Hallelujah.",,,,,,
-1,"Clean and in a great location, the Microtel is at the end of the Billy Graham Parkway where it meets Interstate 85. Plenty of parking and close to a Waffle House, a Japanese buffet and the Cracker Barrel.\n\nRooms are small, as you would expect for a place going by the name Microtel. The bed was comfortable and the room was mostly quiet. One night, there was vacuuming upstairs at 1AM. We called the front desk to complain and the noise stopped.\n\nTip: Avoid the ground floor if you are concerned about security. As with anything near a highway (quick getaway), be aware of your surroundings.\n\nThey do have a shuttle minivan to the airport that isn't far away.\n\nWould I stay here again?

-1,"My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \n\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \n\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \n\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.",,,,,,

The only other item I have had at Rosita's is the chimi. Also good, but if you are a bean and cheese fan, the beans are some of the best in town. That probably also means they are some of the more unhealthy beans in town.",,,,,,
-1,"Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.",,,,,,
1,"After recently returning from Oahu and Maui where I indulged on local cuisine I was craving some good (and cheap) Hawaiian BBQ.  Mokis was the perfect place to put all my cravings to rest.  \n\nPrior to visiting Hawaii in March I never knew exactly what \""Island\"" or \""Hawaiian\"" BBQ was, but now every time I come across any place with a hibiscus flower in the logo I gotta stop and try it out!  Who knew all the way in Arizona, people were doing Hawaiian food, good?!  \n\nMokis has everything that I ate in Hawaii over 7 days all in one spot, from garlic shrimp, to kalua pork to loco moco, even poke and shave iced!  It was hard to choose just one thing so now I have several reasons to return!  I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken with rice and traditional mac salad, everything was delicious and just what I was craving!",,,,,,
1,"I come here whenever I'm baking something special.  They usually have whatever it is I'm looking for.  If not, it usually can't be found anywhere else either.  I also took one of the classes, GREAT instructors, totally worth the money I spent on supplies.  The staff is always friendly.  The rows are kind of small so if the place is packed it can get awkward, but they're jam packed with stuff so it can't be helped.  Do be careful in the entrance/parking area, it can get a little congested and not everyone pays attention.  Wish there was one closer to me. :)",,,,,,

-1,"Although this store has great employees, it is in desperate need of a makeover.  It is absolutely ghetto inside.  I don't think they've redone the store since the early 90s.  It's an embarrassment on Walnut.",,,,,,
-1,"I think I might have been the first person to go to Phil's for a bite to eat.  Ever.  Definitely more a bar - though the business name here is \""tavern\"", they have a sign that says \""deli\"".  I'm not sure I'd call them a deli.  Not by a long shot.  They have food, and they even have subs, but a deli?  I don't think so.  You go to a deli, and you expect a fat greasy guy named Tony to slice some meat and slap it on a roll.  Not some coed to take all your money.\n\nNonetheless, we were there hanging out - with the kids, actually - after I gave blood prior to the Zombie Walk.  Decided to get a bite since we picked up a discount due to the blood drive.  There is a tiny little area for dining if you don't want the total bar vibe.  And when I say tiny, I mean tiny.  I think it was one table.\n\nThe rest of the place is really a bar.  Or tavern if you want to feel more upscale.\n\nService wasn't too hot.  Or maybe it was hot if you're into that scene.  But it wasn't very good.  They were nice enough and all, but they were definitely not into serving a family of four food - they were wanting to get back to the bar (tavern, sorry) side and generate some better tips.\n\nDespite a proclamation on the menu that they had been rated \""uptown's best burgers\"", I wasn't all that impressed.  Maybe I'm burgered out.  It wasn't bad, but like many places they let it cook too long.  Some of the rest of the family enjoyed it, but ultimately we decided that they liked the grease, not the juice (and there is a difference!).  The meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers.  It's more of a challenge to make it tasty and juicy.\n\nSweet Tea Report: Blech.  Possibly the worst in town.  I have had unsweetened tea at places that was sweeter than this stuff.  I will drink most anything in front of me and I didn't even finish half a glass.  Bottom of the barrel.",,,,,,

1,The Boys at Desert Rat are awesome.  I hate car stuff and am always afraid of being taken because I am  a women.   When I went is they asked what the problem was and took care of me without  trying to tell me I needed more than just the shocks.  I felt comfortable with them.  I will send everyone I know.  Thanks guys!!!,,,,,,

-1,"(6/24/2013) Well its time for my 3 year check up to see what the state of my pituitary tumor is. For some unfathomable reason CMC-Pineville wanted me to show up an hour early at the main entrance. There is actually plenty of surface parking this early in the morning so that's a plus. The main waiting area is also empty.\n\nThe MRI waiting room features the wide chairs. Some of the chairs have circular tables offset on their left arms.  The room is painted in muted blue and olive green. There is a 47\"" LG tv hung in the middle of the wall containing the check in window. There is also an alcove with a coffee maker & bottled water.\n\nI had been sitting behind a column & for some odd reason the tech didn't look into the entire room. I had to move nearer to the door and wait for her to come out again. The MRI is a GE model installed in 2006. Most MRI machines have their own noises that can actually be melodic. This machine actually made my body vibrate. It was strange.\n\nSo far it was a five star experience but it was soon time to inject me with the radioactive contrast material. Things started going downhill after the MRI tech & another tech attempted to inject me with the material & instead collapsed my veins in both my arms. They next wanted to try my hands and I refused. I told them to butterfly it into a vein on a forearm. Their response was to stick the needle into my left wrist. The contrast was then pushed into the vein burning its way along. I will never have another MRI done there. Perhaps they knew that they wouldn't be getting excellent reviews of their service as I have not received any surveys to complete.",,,,,,
-1,"The food was great, although my only complaint against this location is our server named Courtney was extremely rude and only showed any friendliness towards my friend and I because the manager was in the building.

1,"I am in love with the Phoenix Symphony!  I have seen two concerts performed by the Phoenix Symphony so far and I cannot wait to see more.  \n\nMost recently, my husband and I watched the Nutcracker.  We purchased the \""cheap seats,\"" which were still pricey.  We arrived 15 minutes late (tacky, I know).  This stunt ended up being a blessing in disguise.  Since we were late the usher told us we had to sit in the balcony until intermission so that we would not disrupt the show by entering through the main doors.\n\nThere were only a handful of people in the balcony so we pretty much got our pick of seats.  The orchestra was down in the pit (correct term?  Dunno.) and we could actually see the full orchestra from that angle.  It was like panorama view!\n\nAt intermission we went to find our actual seats, but we were turned off by how crowded it was.  Plus, our seats were in the second to last row which wasn't exactly a primo spot.  Mind you, Symphony Hall is not that big so there really isn't a bad seat.  We decided that the balcony was better for us so we made our way back upstairs.\n\nThe previous concert we experienced was with Broadway singer, Cheyenne Jackson. These seats were complimentary from the Phoenix Symphony via our apartment \nmanagement.  On this occasion the orchestra was directly on stage backing up the singer.  This was a more intimate set up, whereas The Nutcracker was more grand. \n\nThe Phoenix Symphony is a great way to sneak in a little culture and to experience one of the treasures of downtown Phoenix.",,,,,,
1,"Roy's is a chain that I've been going to for years.   We like to try different places but sometimes you want that place where you know what to expect and still want quality.   It's really my go to place for any occasion.  \n\nThe fish is always the star for me however I've had a lot of different things on the menu including the filet mignon and the seafood dishes.  The menu changes often, but they always have Ahi tuna and the chocolate souffle is a staple at Roy's.  On Valentines or New Years they usually do a prix fixe. \n\nThe service is good and the ambiance is just right.  Not too casual but not too dressy.  I can wear jeans, the Mrs can dress up and we are blending.  \n\nI don't really care it's a chain either.  Some of my favorite places are technically chains.  Is Roy's perfect on every visit?  No but you can tell that they try to be top notch.   They do enough and the food is good enough to keep me coming back over and over.  Isn't that really the sign of a good restaurant?",,,,,,
1,"This was a cool place, sure it's a tourist trap! What do you expect people!! When you walking down main street, the buildings make you wonder about the old wild west days. It's really neat. The first building you walk into is their candy and fudge store! Boy, I spent most of my money their. Fudge was awesome, and you will find some candy that will bring back memories! (If you still have any) This place have a variety of places to visit, they also have three tours, we only went on the train. The train was nice, it's only goes around the town and tells you stories of the past. Hey Taryn C., pull your head out of you liberal ass and smell the roses! No one cares what hell your saying! (trying to keep this clean) Sounded like someone pissed in your cheerios that day? There are tourist traps all over New York, so lay off! When it's all said and done, I had a good time. And will bring my family over to visit.",,,,,,
1,"My daughter and I sort of stumbled on this place a couple of weeks ago.  We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was \""Kids Eat Free\"" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....\n\nThe pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  \n\nSo for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  \nOh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!\n\nTry the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!\n\nThis is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!  Thanks NYPD!!!",,,,,,

1,"It was my first time out to Phoenix, and I only had a few hours to spare before heading out to the wedding I was going to, so I decided to go out to the Desert Botanical Garden.\n\nAs you entered they had a few of the Chuhily glass pieces, which are beautiful and are lit once evening starts to fall. I was also pleased that they offered a student discount with a valid ID. The staff were also very friendly and willing to help and direct you. The plant life was brilliant;  I'm still amazed at the size of the saguaro cacti. Additionally I saw some roadrunners, quail, and other birds.\n\nWhen I went they also had the Monarch Butterfly exhibit, which I visited. There were plently of butterflies to see and take pictures of. Overall, I thought it was worth the money and few hours I spent there.",,,,,,
1,"This is a delicious spot especially for lunch. Sushi is fresh and good. Spicy gyoza soup appetizer is delicious and flavorful. The shrimp lettuce wraps aren't traditional, they taste more like something you would serve on top of rice, however they are amazing!! Tan tan men is good for a cold day, but doesn't have much meat.. Huge portion of noodles though. Place is so cute inside even though it looks like a shitty strip mall location! Must go! I will be back many more times.",,,,,,

-1,"Such a shame because this place has so much potential for being a cool little local business. But the owners/managers are the rudest, most disdainful people who seemed almost gleeful for me to leave without purchasing something. I went in to purchase either some classy paper or a unique card to write a note to a homeowner to whom I was considering placing a purchase offer for their house. It's a stationary store, so I didn't think my request was unusual. The products there were outdated, in many cases even dusty, overpriced (which honestly, I would have paid a local business if the product had been unique and quality), and disorganized. I was asked if I needed help, to which I replied yes and explained my situation, and a very curt man stood in a back corner and pointed to various corners of the store and said, \""Look there and there and there and there,\"" AND THEN HE WALKED OUT OF THE STORE.\n\nI'll seriously never step foot in Weldin's again, and felt it necessary to post publicly about the experience. Such a shame.\n\nBTW, I found a delightful card next door at CVS. It was made of wood. Very unique. Go figure. ;)",,,,,,
-1,If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all. I got a fill and a fix because I broke a nail. First off they didn't cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long. Second off they are so thin I feel like they are just going to crack off.  Not to mention it seems very dirty.. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. One of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me. I will not be returning again.,,,,,,

-1,"I Hesitated to write this review on the Phoenix VA Hospital, but it should be said.  Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older. Diabetes was not magically going away, it needed treatment.    They seemed to have no interest in seeing me.  I could not depend on that, so I have had to make other plans in life. I would not be able to retire in Arizona.    I think that is a shame in itself.  I realize everyone has a different experience, but I gave mine and it is a honest review of what happened to me in 2013.   I was so sorry to hear of the veterans that had died over these delays in care.  It is a disgrace but I am not surprised at all by this behavior in Phoenix.  They obviously are overwhelmed.  They need a 2nd hospital for one thing and a lot more staff.",,,,,,

-1,"I really dislike Menard's.  For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish.",,,,,,
-1,"Has the potential for a sweet, intimate venue.  However, when I went the crowd was very disrespectful, so much so that the artist requested that people stop talking.  I couldn't hear the music due to all the people noise, so I will not go here again for someone I'm really into.",,,,,,
1,"This place was amazing.  I went there for lunch today and I can't wait to go back.  I was greeted at the door by Angelo, the owner.  I felt very special and welcomed.  The atmosphere was very intimate.  Kind of reminds you of an East Coast old school Italian restaurant.  \n\nThe trio of pasta was excellent.  My favorite was the gnocchi in Alfredo sauce.  All 3 were fabulous, but the gnocchi was exceptional. \n\nI've already made plans to go back for dinner with my husband.  \n\nI went on Groupon, just to try it out, but I would have gladly paid full price.",,,,,,
1,"I want to talk about the Pizza at Niccoli's! A few decades ago my best friend and I discovered this place. Note: we both come from Italian family's who were raised on good ingredients that only a deli can have. This is not your hut kind of pizza. Then we went back and poof it was gone! Skip forward a couple of decades, and we were still talking about this pizza and how good it really is, when our friend said, \""Oh yeah, I know where they are now.\"" We got over there had the pizza and BAM there was the best Pizza we ever had in Phoenix! If you are looking for an authentic NYC pizza made with ingredients only Italians use, Niccoli's is the place.",,,,,,
-1,"Let's talk about the weird interaction I had with a Barista here.  I asked if they offered free internet.  Simple question, right?  She hesitated and then went on this whole diatribe about how it used to be free, and then it wasn't and now it kinda is, but she wasn't sure.  I swear that's exactly what she said.  So she hesitantly gives me this paper, pulled off from a whole stack mind you, of the Internet name and password.  At this point I'm confused...do you not want me to be here?  Is it free?  I finally got my answer when I logged on with no issues, it's free.  Why all the hassle??\n\nThe only reason I can see (and seriously a big one) is the coffee shop hanger on-ers.  I can only imagine how this has become an epidemic in spots like this.  Hip spots with lots of students and recent grads who want to scope out the free internet havens.  I get it....the coffee shop wants you to get your coffee, hang out for approximately 2 hours and leave.  I'm sure this is not the case...and that people hang out enough that they could easily put on an apron and handle orders behind the counter.  So long story short, this place is PACKED.  Packed like you usually have to take a couple laps to find a free table....or even lone chair!  It's a little annoying. Plus, you're most likely going to see what the person next to you/on top of you is doing.  Oh, sweet game of chess there dude....\n\nOh yeah, my chai was okay, Oregon Chai Mix (my third fav after a homemade mix or Intellegentsia).   Made exactly how I ordered it, extra hot, which a lot of people do not do correctly (it needs to burn my tongue, for realz).  \n\nBut for me, this is a spot I'd avoid....way too crowded!",,,,,,
1,"Phoenix is very fortunate to have such an awesome zoo. It is an awesome zoo that left a strong impression on me when I visited in 2004. Fast forward eight years, and we drove over 200 miles from Las Vegas to Phoenix to see it. The Phoenix Zoo is so awesome that if I had the power, I would trade the best Las Vegas casino for the Phoenix Zoo. Since I don't have that power, I will write a review of why the Phoenix Zoo is so awesome.Instead of repeating facts such as admission is $20, I broke the review into sections. Each section discusses the awesome characteristics of the sections of the zoo.\n\nTropics Trail\n\n  As Phoenix builds a bigger and better Phoenix Zoo, the temporary entrance is near Tropics Trail at the far right . This is where visitors get their first impressions of the Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are the elephant, jaguar, tortoise, iguana, Andean Bear, rhinoceros, anteater, flamingo, and manned wolf. \n\nChildren's Trail\n\n  The southeast section of the Phoenix Zoo is more than a children's zoo. Because it sits on the south side of water it is a hot spot for waterfowl viewing. On the path to the petting zoo is emu, bald eagles, an island showcasing siamang, warty pigs, and ocelot. The highlight of the Children's Trail is the Harmony Farm. Grownup children will also enjoy the Big Red Barn and windmill house.\n\nThe Main Lake\n\n  The Main Lake is the central right area of Phoenix Zoo where the walkways circle Main Lake. Besides the Main Lake; the highlight exhibits include Land of the Dragons, two islands showcasing lemur, otter, flamingos, and gibbon. For an additional expense there is a camel ride. By this time you might be hungry or thirsty. The Cavern Cafe serves decent food and soft drinks.\n\nAfrica Trail\n\n  The Africa Trail sits at the back center of Phoenix Zoo. The highlight exhibits are cheetahs, African wild dog, baboons, mandrils, warthogs, lions, and tigers.\n\nArizona Trail\n\n  The Arizona Trail is my favorite area of the Phoenix Zoo. It is here that a visit to the zoo changes into a hike into wild Arizona. The bighorn sheep exhibit is off the charts well done. The bighorn sheep exhibit incorporates a real mountain. This is the exhibit that leaves an imprint that Phoenix Zoo is awesome. It could be the best bighorn sheep exhibit in the country. Throughout Arizona Trail, natural Arizona treats the zoogoer to four star scenery and first rate pictures. It is the part of the zoo where bunny rabbits outpopulate wild animals. The Wild Arizona Trail, in my opinion is worth $10 of the $20 admission.\n\n  The Arizona Trail is discontinuous. To the left of the Zoo Plaza there is a more developed Arizona Trail. Here the highlight exhibits are bobcats, Mexican Wolf, Mountain lion, and pronghorn. This is also where the First Aid Station is located.\n\nThe Savanna\n\n  The Savanna is the center of the Phoenix Zoo. In the future it will be the main entrance. It serves as the plaza and savanna section of the Phoenix Zoo. Here you have Savanna Grill (my brother said there burgers are good) and Karibu Cafe. This is where the gift shop is. The main Safari Train Station is here. The highlight exhibit is a savanna showcasing giraffes, eland, and zebras. There is also a stingray bay.\n\nThe Exit\n\n  I left the Phoenix Zoo impressed. I was disheartened that it closes at 4 p.m. and that Las Vegas does not have a Phoenix Zoo. Headed to my car, it was time to explore more of Phoenix. Phoenix Zoo is near downtown Phoenix and Tempe, and Arizona Mills.",,,,,,
1,"We love to get take out at Los Taquitos on a busy week night when we are too tired to cook. They are super fast and dinner for 4 is usually under $20! \n\nI love the street tacos and my husband the ceviche. Son loves the carne asada burrito, daughter the tamales. Seriously something for everyone. There IS some variability in the spicy factor, but we are total regulars. Gotta try it!",,,,,,
1,"I got to thinking about Osso Bucco the other day.\n\nMy new Dutch Ovens brought this on, I'm kind of obsessed with braised meat right  now. What to braise, how to braise, which pot to use... must be because of the freezing cold temperatures. \n\nAnyway. \n\nA few years back my dad and the evil stepmonster (she's gone now, as in they got divorced, in their 70's, can I hear an AMEN sister?) could not stop talking about Christos. \n\nThey would talk about it all the time. \n\nIn Oregon.\n\nLike, in the middle of a nice dinner at Jake's. \n\nWeird.\n\nAlso, rude. \n\nI just chalked it up to stepmonster's name dropping mental health condition. \n\nNo seriously, she drops names all the time. ANNOYING. anyway, ahem.\n\nIt was Osso Bucco this, Osso Bucco that, Christos this, Christos that. \n\nSo, when I was down there on a visit, post stepmonster,  I made my Dad take me.\n\nIt's good stuff. \n\nI don't even eat veal. \n\nBut the Osso Bucco rocks. \n\nEverything else did, too. I liked the service, the feel of the place, and I liked the calamari, and the wine. All good. \n\nif you're in Phoenix and you want a good meal, I'd say this is one of the places to go.",,,,,,
1,"As a Phoenician I sometimes forget that we're lucky to have nature trails in the midst of the urban sprawl of this desert city. We may not have a memorable downtown skyline but something Phoenix does have a lot of are mountains that serve as a backdrop of gorgeous scenery. We are blessed to have many mountains with trails in each \""park\"" like North Mountain, the Mcdowell's, the Estrella's, Camelback, and the Grand Dame of Phoenix, South Mountain. This range or urban park which is considered the world's largest serves as a visual landmark to many. During the day, coming from downtown and head down Central Ave, South Mountain towers majestically over this metropolis and at night, the glimmering red lights of the tv/radio towers that sit at its summit just sparkle. It provides direction, and this natural backdrop can also lay claim to being a memorable Phoenix landmark. But apart from its visual beauty this urban park provides an active recreation outlet to residents of metro Phoenix for it has many different trailheads at various points from Ahwatukee to Laveen. I liken South Mountain to be like Runyon Canyon in Hollywood, but here we have far more trails and it ranges from the easy to the difficult. And like Runyon Canyon you can drive up South Mountain and look below and see the grand expanse of sprawl glowing under the night sky and just take it all in. Yes, we are lucky to have this, literally in our backyard.",,,,,,
1,"I'm probably not a dentist or dental hygienists' dream.  I tend to not keep up with regular appointments and I'm ridiculously nervous in any area of the dentist office.  This has been my M.O. my whole life.  But my few experiences at Artistic Dental may have changed that for me.  Here's a few areas worth noting.\n\nThe office.  Artist Dental has a beautiful office located in the Camelback Corridor area.  They provide a very relaxed, homey feel to their waiting area, where you have a choice of chilled bottled waters, keurig coffees and teas and various snacks.  I don't imagine anyone who was about to see the dentist take up any of these offers but it's nice to the have the option while waiting for someone else or as you're headed out of the office.  Additionally, they provide views from each dentist chair (not sure what they are called) so you can see the sky and the beautiful church across the street.  They also have water features and lots of greenery to help soothe the nerves.  :) \n\nStaff.  The staff is really remarkable.  They provide wonderful customer service and professionalism.  They certainly make you feel like they care about you and make you feel comfortable and let's face it, no one feels comfortable at the dentist office.\n\nMary M. (dental hygienist), is one of the most kind, gentle and pleasant people I've been around.   She does an excellent job and shows remarkable patience for squirmy patients like me.  \n\nI've recently had the pleasure of working with Dr. Adhikari.  She has greatly helped with my fear of being in the dentist chair.  She's caring, patient and extremely funny which only makes the process that much easier.   I recently had to have a partial on my back molar and she made the process feel like a cake walk.  She explained all the steps, took a conservative approach and and established a relationship with me which made me feel at ease.   Because of Dr. Adhikari, I'm now brave enough to move forward with a dental issue I've been putting on the back burner for years.  \n\nBritni (Dental Assistant), was also a great pleasure to work with.  She is extremely professional but in a kind and gentle way. \n\nAdditional, the office allows for fraidy cats like me to listen to music while having any work done, rather it's a cleaning or something like a crown and cozy up in their plush blankets to help relax the nerves.  :)\n\nThe office of Artist Dental is a top notch office and I would highly recommend it as your dentist office too.",,,,,,
-1,Always busy!  Selection of veggies are ok.  Selection of fruit is a little below average.  Otherwise it has everything you'd expect from a chain grocery store.\n\nMain complaint with this location is that the organization of aisles and products are not logical.  You often see items in multiple locations because the layout of the store was clearly not thought out.,,,,,,
1,"Items selected included:\nBlueberry Cake\nButtermilk Cake\nStrawberry Raised\nApple Fritter\nChocolate Oreo\nMaple Bacon\n\nFor their last day in Phoenix I took my mother and aunt to La Grande Orange - easily my favorite spot in The Valley - but being late risers I decided to grab some donuts beforehand just down the street at Rainbow Donuts, an independent branch of the local chain that many claim to make the best donuts in the area.  Opening early - I believe 4am - and at least by 5:15am when I arrived on 12/31 the shop is small and anything but trendy, the only other patrons during my visit a trio of old veterans who apparently meet there daily, but with a friendly staff and an interesting selection of classics and novel options alike I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nSelecting a half dozen donuts and taking portions of each home it likely comes as no surprise that the warm cake donuts were my favorite - the buttermilk bar literally still dripping glaze - and with the blueberry subtle and light plus the fritter less greasy than the average with a great crunch giving way to cinnamon apples within I enjoyed all three more than those that were raised - the dough a bit less wispy or raised than I prefer and the frosting on both the maple and the strawberry a bit too artificial, though the Oreo option was admittedly quite good as the frosting approximated the flavor of Nestle Quick.",,,,,,

-1,Quite possibly the SLOWEST moving place on earth. Took over 30 mins to get a car. \n\nWait line is slow and long to get keys and then super long wait for car to be pulled up. \n\nDoesn't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient?\n\nAvoid this one if you can.,,,,,,
1,"There is nothing bad I can say about my experience here. The staff was wonderful, the nurses were wonderful, and most importantly Dr. Nelson was the best doctor I could have ever asked for.

1,"Generous portions and seriously good food at cheap prices. Although I'm no expert, I hear the food is remarkably authentic, with Japanese, Chinese and Korean influences. I especially like the Hawaiin chicken rice and pork laulau. Oh, and don't forget the mayo-macaroni salad served with every order. All this culture in a strip mall at the crossroads of Tempe, Chandler & Mesa. Aloha!",,,,,,
1,"This one time, at Apollos, some gay dudes asked my friend and I if we were real women. I knew I should have waxed my mustache before going out that night! \n\nBut never mind that snafu- I always feel like a diva here!\n\nThe girls and I have been to Apollos a handful of times for karaoke and I'm always a drunken mess every time I leave there. Well I certainly can't handle my liquor but the drinks are poured well here. They have cheap cheap drinks and the first  time I was there, I think the Pink Panther martinis did it for me. They were only $4 too!\n\nGreat place to gather a bunch of friends for karaoke. Yes its a gay bar but the coolest one. I've always met great guys there. They are never interested in me but they are always so nice and willing to sing a duet with me. The karaoke host is always fun, not a mic hog like some places. My only complaint is that my gay friends like to sing lots of show tunes. BORING! There are definitely some great performers here and but most are here to have a good time so don't feel like you need to belt like Whitney Houston to come here. \n\nMy favorite things about Apollos are:\n1) free fresh popcorn! best thing to munch on after you've had a lot to drink\n2) the ladies room never has a line because its mainly gay dudes that frequent this place\n\nI love Apollos!",,,,,,
-1,"I took my sixteen year old  Scottie in because he had stopped eating and drinking and was very, very ill.  I had called the night before to tell them that if he lived through the night, I would be bringing him in.  He was in total distress and clinging to life.  \nI was put in a room, where I was told to wait for an unknown time.  My dog was gasping for air.  I asked that he be viewed as the emergency,  that he was.  I was told again to sit down and wait.  I waited for a few more minutes and then walked out!  I went straight to Orangewood Pet Hospital where I was immediately taken care of and where blood work done. It was obvious that my dog needed to be put to sleep.  The experience was as good as any experience of that nature could be.  I am disgusted with the clinical, uncaring atmosphere of Squaw Peak Animal Hospital.",,,,,,
-1,"We bought our son a 2004 car here about a month ago. So far, we had to have the clutch replaced. Luckily it happened within 3 days of purchasing it so they fixed it for free. BUT, the car has been giving our son trouble when trying to start it. Dropped it at a local shop to see what is wrong. You name it - it needs replaced! Over $2000 to get it fixed. And some of these things are safety items and shouldn't be driven by anybody! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all and I WILL NEVER EVER return! Total rip off kind of people! Not trustworthy! I can't imagine doing this to people every day. What kind of people are they? What a sad day.",,,,,,
-1,"I decided to try this place after reading on Yelp how good it is.  This is no Mike and Tony's or big greek gyro in Market square.  I won't be back.  They only take cash. The workers are not Greek chefs and are very condescending.   The gyro sandwich for $5 was OK at best.  They threw some tomatoes on it. The sauce could be better.  The fries for $2.50 were undercooked.  I asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle.  We are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. It was definitely not Heinz which is a sin in Pittsburgh!   I had to hunt silverware and straws.  You would think they would give them to you with the meal.  \n\nThey charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills.  They put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution.  You can also get a drink from their cooler for $1.  They are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less.  \n\nTables were not very clean.  I was surprised at the number of patrons.  This place is definitely regularly visited. They have daily specials, but the #1 item on my list is quality and taste of food.  They get a C from me.",,,,,,

-1,"I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \""I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\"" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \"" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\"" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all.",,,,,,
-1,"Nope. Sorry, I grew up in pgh. Heart of a true pittsburgher. But my gosh. One word for prantl's: crisco. Seriously, my arteries hurt after eating a desert from this place.

-1,"I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for. \n\nFor starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.\n\nThe staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.\n\nImperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons.",,,,,,
-1,I know this is just a grocery store but I have never had such an unpleasant experience at any other grocery store.  The employees were not helpful in locating the items I needed and their selection is limited.  I never get asked if I found everything ok.  Also upon my first visit there when asked if I had their preferred shopper card and I said no because I just moved to the area. At that point I was not offered the option of obtaining a card so that I could enjoy their preferred pricing on items.   If I had the option of a different grocery store closer I would definitely avoid this store.,,,,,,
-1,"I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.\n\nThe entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the \""fancy\"" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.\n\nThis place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.",,,,,,
1,"This is my pediatrician and I absolutely love them! I switched from N. Scottsdale Pediatrics because I never saw the same Dr. twice there. It felt more like a clinic and I wanted to establish a trusting relationship with my Pediatrician who would be there consistently for my children.\n\nI couldn't be happier. It's not as fancy with flat screen tv's and decor as the N. Scottsdale office, but the care my family has received has been stellar. Pretty much everyone I know goes to them know and I haven't heard anything but positive stories.\n\nDuring flu season, they're open on the weekends! Who does that? I feel 100% confident about recommending them.",,,,,,
-1,"We went here on a Friday night so it was extremely busy, which is to be expected.  \n\nHowever management obviously didn't plan staffing well because the waitresses were in a frenzy trying to keep up.  Our particular waitress was clearly unnerved and looked miserable.  It wasn't hard to see that she didn't want to make small talk, she just wanted you to hurry up and order.  So we did.  It took a really long time for the food to come up.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our main entrees.  The food was just ok, and our waitress messed up my dining companion's order and when we asked about it she was like, \""oh sorry!\"" as she dashed away and that was the end of that.  \n\nSo the food was average, not great.\nThe service was rushed and unfriendly.\nNot worth the price.",,,,,,

-1,"I got there at midnight to pick up my rental and the entrance was gated... After checking to make sure we weren't missing another possible entrance, we drove up to the exit and the pleasant employee informed me that they close the gate at midnight and everyone has to come in through this way... You know what would have been nice?  A sign that says that on the closed gate!  Something with a nice, little arrow that says, \""Hey, we're still open, just go right down here.\""  Is that hard?  I guess so.\n\nInside, the woman working at the counter was nice... She had me completely finished in about 10 minutes and I headed out to the car... It was a 2013 White Dodge Dart... I took a nice lap around the outside to make sure there weren't any dings or anything and went off into the night... I heard a weird ping sound while I was driving a few minutes in, but it was directly behind me, so I figured I would just check it out when I got home since we live pretty close to the airport... Ladies and gentlemen, I got home and checked the backseat of my rental car to find an empty bottle of Great Lakes' delicious Commodore Perry IPA!  Look, I understand that it's a delicious beer... I love beer almost any time, but you know when I don't love it?  When it's in my rental car, rolling around in the backseat with a fricking open container charge attached to it! What the H?! Upon contacting them the next day (because the manager wasn't onsite), I found out that the manager would \""talk to the employee\"" that cleans the cars, but they would accommodate me when I returned... \n\nThe car worked fine for the trip and it was time to return it... We pulled into the bay... We cleaned the interior and unpacked the luggage, but still hadn't seen a person to check us in... After about 10 minutes, I spotted two employees standing by a door, doing nothing... As I walked by them, they walked into the bay of cars, but only pressed on the hoods of them for some reason and just leisurely walked on to the next... Once I got to the front of the bay, I noticed a small sign that didn't even reach past the height of the hood of the car it was in front of ... It said that they do not have people to check in their cars... You have to leave the keys in the ignition, write down the mileage and check in the car inside... So no inspection upon return, guys?  I'm just supposed to trust that you won't run up some random charge on my card for damage or what not?  Really? \n\nInside was a straight up flustercluck... There is no other way to describe it... About 15 people waiting in line for TWO attendants and one of them ended up being tied up by one lady from France who didn't know she needed a $200 hold on her card... Apparently her boyfriend rented the car for her, but she doesn't have any more money and he won't go to the bank to put more money in the account... But she doesn't understand because this is a once in a lifetime thing and he never does anything for her and she needs him to leave where he is and go to the bank...  But he doesn't... At least not for the half hour I was in line to return this stupid car... The employee listened to her calmly and explained her options, so he gets points for that, at least... Then I noticed two other people come out of the back, walk through the area we were in and head outside... One of them was very clearly identified as a manager... How in the H do you miss a loudly complaining customer and about 15 other people with extremely unhappy looks on their faces packed into your lobby if you're in charge of something?  Oh, I know... You just don't give a f***... That's how.\n\nUgh.  Look, if you want to be open 24 hours, then you need to have enough employees on staff to make that happen as smoothly as possible... Otherwise, just close down and leave that for people that understand that good customer service doesn't only happen during traditional business hours! Oh! And my accommodation made for my possible arrest?  A 10% off coupon for another rental... Let me tell you where you can put that... On my next trip out of town, I will be renting a horse and leaving days ahead of schedule...",,,,,,

1,Ladies and gentlemen let's get our feed bags on the portions are huge here. When you enter the restaurant there is a lot to take in lots of things all over to look at but pretty cool. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak two fork tender pieces of beef lightly battered fried and topped with  homemade gravy. All entrees served with salad or Cole Slaw homemade mashed potatoes and gravy or texaz fries bread and butter. I would say this meal could feed someone for a week it's a lot of food but really good so if you want a great Chicken Fried Steak it's a must try.,,,,,,
1,"After a 9 year absence from the Valley, I needed to find a stylist. I have fine, thin, 85% grey hair that I wear blond and highlighted.  Eva is a caring stylist and very good with color. After 6 months she changed the color to make a darker low light and gave me blond highlights which look quite good. Her haircuts are spot on. She takes the time to listen to your concerns and is eager to please.  I agree that assistants sometimes do the blow dry and/or shampoo. I'd rather have Eva do everything, but understand the cooperative nature of the salon. I think blowdrying should be included in the price of your cut and color, but it is extra, making it an expensive but necessary procedure. I would recommend the salon and especially Eva.",,,,,,

They both were good. Service was fast.\n\nNote:\n** We asked for extra tzatziki and we were charged 49 cents for it. It was a little too much dill for my taste but it was OK.\n** We were coming from the movies, so we had had our huge drinks... I had an Entertainment Book coupon but it was pretty much useless, because it is for only 50% off a second entree, and you have to order 2 drinks... so it not much of a deal, you probably are better off skipping the coupon and the sodas (healthier and cheaper)\n** However... we asked for water and... it tastes terrible. I think it has happened before. For the last year or so I am trying to drink more plain water and less sugary drinks/artificial sweeteners, so this is not the place for that : (\n\nWe also thought the gyros seemed smaller this time.\n\nLast time I think I ordered a gyro salad and it was good and huge.

-1,"Well, I read the reviews and thought this would be impressive. Nothing could be farther from the truth! The dude at the counter appeared annoyed that we interrupted him yesterday, the portions on the beans and potato salad were miniscule (I was unaware that you could even serve beans and potato salad in a cup designed for condiments, but lo and behold, here it was--- 3 bites later and both were history). We had the pulled pork sandwiches, and I make better at home. The bbq sauce was good, but that was about it. We don't plan on coming back ever, especially not for $23.00 for 2 people... But, we did fill up on gelato at the mall about 20 minutes later as we were still hungry when we left. I'm wondering where in the heck the other folks on here ate, because this wasn't at all the same experience they had.",,,,,,
-1,"\""WOW, this place is EXPENSIVE!\"" ... is what I would say if Dean & Deluca cut all their prices in half.\n\nI'm giving them 1 star because I feel that they make no effort at all to cater to anyone other than the uber-rich.   Like everything else in Phillips Place, D&D is just another spot where the wealthiest people in Charlotte can spend obscene sums of money on stuff they really don't need, while the rest of the country struggles to find employment and to stop their houses from being foreclosed upon.\n\nDon't get me wrong, D&D has high-quality, delicious foods.  If I had a few million dollars in the bank, and didn't mind getting ripped off, I'd probably do all my shopping here.",,,,,,

1,"lol, the stories of the owner cutting off college kids who try to practice their Japanese on him makes me like the guy even more.  The food is pretty good, too.

1,"The most Amazing Croissants I've had outside of Paris. My husband and enjoyed omlettes with croissants.  We shared a Chocolate Croissant with coffee and savored every bite. I bought 2 more Chocolate Croissants to bring home for my daughters. Authentic French pastries and the staff is very kind. The best part, no wait or noisy crowds on a Saturday morning. This place is definitely a treasure worth every penny. We'll be back for more yummy French cuisine. Come and taste for yourself!",,,,,,
1,"I am a fan. But I would like to be more of a fan, and so I am here harping on the two problems I have with CC. One is the parking mentioned by other reviewers and the other is the bad service at the food court. I don't mean the samples handed out on almost every aisle and the hassle of the lines as stereotypical fat people line up like hippos at a rotten carcass to 'just try a sample'. I mean the little restaurant inside the store where the hippos line up to drown their peptides in sugar and grease. The food at any CC is outstanding fast food at an unbelievably good price. The pizza is fresh and really tasty and only 9.99 for a whole pie, the soft-serve yogurt is a huge portion in a plastic cup for 1.49. The hotdogs are terrific. Everything else is good and cheap too. There are no problems with the food quality and price. It's the service. The service is indifferent and inconsistent. Somedays it's ok to order pizza to be picked up later for a party, and somedays it is not ok and the workers will claim that it is not a service and never has been. Liars. Fat liars. I actually typed lairs by accident which works too. I'm done with this review due to boredom. I just can't stand it when a great business carelessly regresses to the mean. Brave the parking and the neutral service because when you need a good hotdog/pizza/frozen yogurt, it's a great spot.",,,,,,

My regular order is  the pound of wings for $5 and then usually a Three Olive Vodka special. Lots of combos there, and all are tasty. There are TVs all around the place so now that baseball season is in swing you have no problems in seeing a game if its on. The service is friendly and the food comes up quick.",,,,,,
1,"I love my doc (Dr. Patterson). He takes the time to listen, answer questions and discuss treatment options. He's open minded, knowledgeable and makes me feel confident in his recommendations and insights. For that he's worthy of a 5-star rating.\n\nUnfortunately, he's typically 30-45 minutes (or more!) behind in the afternoons which means I have to take off a half day of work because there is no way to make it back to the office. For that, I feel compelled to only leave 4-stars for a doc that in every other way is a 5-star.",,,,,,
1,"Another visit to one of my favorite lunch-time haunts with my Zach. Can't stop trying the nachos, but have also branched out and tried the lengua tacos (yum) and some of the other specialties on the menu.

1,My family has been going to PV Eyecare for many years. We have never had any issue with the staff or Dr. Rios who is the best! Appointments are flexible and prices are competetive. This is a no pressure place- unlike other places. You can buy your frames/contacts  there or they will give you your prescription and you can go elsewhere. I am not familiar with any of the other doctors that are there but if you need a great eye doctor- try Dr. Rios.,,,,,,

Everytime I go the staff is welcoming and friendly,  I  would recommend to my friends.",,,,,,
-1,"I feel like the owner had a bet as to how much money they could steal from a customer that day. I was charged for services I didn't ask for, quoted on other products that were so outrageous I almost threw up. $400 to change 2 radiator hoses? seriously? I'm talking about 2 belts that can be purchased for less than $30.  \n\nI was a long time customer that loved the service initially then found it to be more and more suspicious as time went buy. In the end you just knew you were getting ripped off, but it won't happen again. Go somewhere else.",,,,,,
-1,"Bought a Groupon and used #1 of 3.  Not sure I will go back to use the other 2. The food was not good at all. Ordered a cheeseburger, potato salad another bacon cheeseburger and Hawaiian coleslaw.  To drink we ordered a chocolate malt and a strawberry shake. The cheeseburgers were frozen patties and cooked clean into next week. Dry hockey pucks. The potato salad was ok the Hawaiian coleslaw was very blah.. The shake and malt were delicious even though they were not delivered until our burgers were finished. The waitstaff was like the walking dead, they had not an ounce of enthusiasm. When we sat down not one person acknowledged we were there. Waitress was not friendly either. No French fries!!! Potato salad, chips, coleslaw, carrot raisin salad. Wow! This place could be a goldmine, how about a friendly staff, and pattied burgers and if you can't have a deep fryer, how about some American Fries made from good old boiled potatoes. Put it this way, you get out of the place what you put into it and this place needs to step it up!",,,,,,

It was a friday night and we didnt have to wait to be seated which was amazing.  Our server however was very poor.  When i asked her about a gluten free menu (it had been over a year since i had been here so i figured i would ask just in case) - she replied with \""we dont have anything gluten free\"" .  I rephrased the question.. No we dont have anything gluten free.. I asked.. Salad? She replied oh yeah i guess that is gluten free.. so anyways.. I have been gluten free for a couple years now so i can pick out things i know i can eat and what i cant.  I ended up ordering.. Salad - no croutons please... of course, the salad came out with croutons... i sent it back asking for one without.  \nWings came out after entrees... \nfood was mediocre at best.  \nJust really not what i have come to expect.",,,,,,

1,"I have always had fresh food here. The service is nice and simple. \n\nI had the 2 Spicy tacos in soft corn shells, with cheese, sour cream, pico and lettuce. Served with chips and a drink for under 6 bucks. \n\nThe meat was good, not too spicy at all, the chips were a little greasy but I like that and the salsa bar was good. None of the salsa's were over the top good or hot. I suggest getting the \""super hot\"" from the people before you sit down. \n\nThe place was clean and the price was excellent.",,,,,,

1,"Delicious tacos! $6something for 3 tacos beans and rice and a mini salad. So good! Me and my husband both had the carne Assad tacos and they were good! My husband said his was kinda dry, but the flavor was there. Don't come here looking for a posh environment because it's not. It's a good ol taqueria and I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nParking lot is a little small, and it's kind of hard to spot the place at first glance but once you make it in there you'll be glad you tried them out! The red salsa is better than the green one, and they have Pepsi in a bottle! :)",,,,,,
-1,"Perhaps my experience left me feeling bitter simply because I was not aware that you are supposed to cook your own steaks.... Wait, restaurant... cook my own food????\n\nMe and my dad went here because we were hungry for a steakhouse steak, but imagine our surprise when we walked in and our waitress explains how the restaurant works.  Oh, you can have the house chef cook the steak for you, but its $3 or something extra.... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me...  Well, we didn't come to cook, so we bit the bullet and got the chef to cook our food.  \n\nBut putting aside the whole \""cook your own steak\"" deal, the restaurant was still very poor to me.  The prices are absolutely ridiculous.  Every entree was above $20 and we didn't exactly get a ton of food.  My platter was a medium sized steak, a small baked potato, and a very small serving of veggie mix.  The salad bar was very poor.  Very limited selection, and the food looked old and wilted.  \n\nOur waitress was rarely around the whole night, and we even were placed on a side of the restaurant with barely any people.  This was especially troublesome based on how we were never given silverware, needed drink refills, and more napkin quite a few times.  Still, our waitress was never around.  \n\nTo be honest, most of the people in the restaurant weren't even eating...  It was mostly bar goers and people sitting around for drinks.   Not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least. \n\nAll and all, I won't be going back here.  Food wasn't bad, but it was very under-portioned and ridiculously over priced.  The service was bad at least on the night I went, the salad bar was very sub-par, and most of the people in the restaurant were just there for drinks.   I can't get into the \""cook my own steak\"" deal either.  Hell, I just would have stayed home and made my own steak for a 1/4 of the price.",,,,,,
-1,"I want to like this location for a number of reasons: they have a chef on site doing cooking demonstrations and handing out samples. The staff is really nice when it's crowded. They're a Market District location, so they've got a good amount of prepared (or 'oven-ready') foods. It's close to my house.\n\nBut going here is ALWAYS such a nightmare.\n\nThe parking lot is miserable. There's a tiny lot area, and then an underground parking garage, but both are a pain to navigate and find a space in. I have never been here when there wasn't a long wait at the deli (and the deli order machine is always down, so you really have no choice but to wait in the line). The aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size. \n\nThis store has a lot of potential, and it *is* the biggest GE in the immediate city area, but I always leave frazzled and anxious, so I'd rather just make the drive to the suburbs for my Giant Eagle shopping trip.",,,,,,
-1,"This place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money!! The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. \n\nSincerely,\n Matt K.\n\nHere is the response that I got\n\nPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThank you for making me aware of the situation.\nJoey DeMarco \n\nI promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money. Support local businesses, but make sure they are deserving of your money!",,,,,,
1,"Alright seriously if you rate AJ's less than 5 than you're a buffoon.  Seriously think about this for a minute.  AJ's offers top quality products and specialty items that you can't find at your typical supermarket.  IE. Langoustines.  Is the store pricey? Yes, but you're paying for top quality products so I don't mind.  Their cheese selections blows any main competitor away as well as their prepared food.  I could go on forever breaking down each department, but I will not bore you.  Shell out the few extra dollars and shop here, you won't be disappointed!",,,,,,
-1,Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service,,,,,,
-1,"Ordered for delivery..giving the information was painful. The person on the other line had an attitude and had trouble coping the information. I don't think I could have spoken any slower. I was told 35 min. Well 35 turned into 55. That extra 20 is an eternity when you have 3 hungry boys under 6yo. When I called back to see where it was I was again greeted with an attitude. Pleasant..right? Well we got to pizza, and it was cold. NEVER again. I'm going back to Danny's.",,,,,,

I hope that wing is next in line to get renovated.  \n\nOnce I moved towards the center, it was a lot cleaner looking, but I wasn't crazy about the food selection.  Cinnabon, BBQ, pizza with 4 slices of tomato on it and that's it?  It's tough to be a vegetarian in NC, I guess.  And the lines for the food were ghastly!  Anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line.  I guess I could have had a 5,000 calorie cinnamon bun for lunch.\n\nAnd yes, I gave an extra star for free wifi.",,,,,,
-1,"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the selection on the menu, as it offers food you cant really find anywhere else in the C-U.  I thought the menu items were decently priced, maybe a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food.  \n\nI ordered three tapas dishes - the grilled plantains, the goat cheese, and the beef tacos.  The goat cheese was fried and served with honey and bread and it was absolutely delicious!  The plantains were pretty plain, but still a nice change of pace from what I normally eat day to day.  The beef tacos were tasty, but they were incredibly hard to eat when served in dry corn shelled tortillas.  They cracked and fell apart so it was a bit frustrating to end up having to eat a taco with a fork.  \n\nOur service was absolutely terrible, I had to flag down the host at one point to get my water glass refilled, and she brought out all of our food at different times which was a bit strange.  \n\nOverall, I was happy with the food I ordered and how it was prepared and how it tasted - were talking about Champaign, Illinois, not Chicago or New York - and unhappy with the service.  I wouldn't tell someone not to go there, because it is a unique restaurant for this area, but I would be warned that the service will likely be disappointing.",,,,,,
-1,"Just went to grab a quick lunch to go and must say this is the wrost prepared food to date. I've gone hear at least 30 times before and this is the first time that I can honestly say it sucked. They weren't really busy, since I went at 10:30 am. I hope this isn't a new trend.",,,,,,
-1,"Yesterday, my daughter and I were given free tickets to see \""The Whispers!\""  As she's never been there before and her birthday is this coming Sunday, I thought why not celebrate?\n\nThe ticket said that we had to arrive before 6:30 to not revert to paying $15 apiece, so we arrived at 6 pm.  Parking is $5, collected as soon as you arrive.  If you want to avoid the mad rush getting outta there, strategically park near the exit (or near where you entered).\n\nThe line wasn't terribly long but the wait for the 8:30 show (2.5 hours)  was unendurable .  If you use either a walker or wheel chair, I don't believe this place is handicap accessible as I saw no ramps for either.  You only have the option to walk upstairs or downstairs.  The facility had minimal air conditioning and with the crowd it was very hot both inside and outside on the patio.  You would think they' would at least have a mist sprinkler system outside along with more chairs!  Also, you could see the patio is desperately in need of structural repairs. Obviously, the facility expected us to buy drinks while we waited.  But who wants to drink over priced alcohol drinks when you're uncomfortably hot and dehydrated? \n\nWhile everyone raves about getting a good view from any seat, the seats themselves are packed closely together.  I'm 5'5\"" and my knees were scrunched by the seat in front of me.  Also if you've heavyset, the seats are small.  Acoustics are good. And I've had yet to attend an event here that starts on time???\n\nOverall, I'd avoid this place.  If you must go, remember:  You get what you pay for.",,,,,,
1,"I'm relatively new to town and was searching for a great spot to get an oil change. After reading reviews and calling a couple places to inquire about pricing, I selected Avis Lubrication.\n\nWhen I arrived, a friendly gentleman met me at my car and asked if I had ever visited the shop. He then asked me a few simple questions about myself (name, address, etc.) and my car (year, make, etc.) Within five minutes, my vehicle was being pulled into the bay and being worked on. I found this impressive considering there were two cars ahead of me. While one employee changed the oil, another was washing the windows and checking the tire pressure. \n\nAfter my experience at Avis Lubrication, I can definitely say I'll be back. These guys are courteous, prompt and efficient. Within twenty minutes of pulling up (and paying less than I was quoted at other highly reviewed spots), I was on my way. Thank you, Avis!",,,,,,
1,"I purchased a voucher from Living Social; $10 for $20 towards food.  I'd gitten a sweet PayPal deal a while back and we enjoyed the pizza so I bought this voucher.  I am so pleased that I did.  We sat in a bck booth (luckily away from the live musician).  We ordered baked ziti and spinach lasagna.   The hubby go a sald yo go with his ziti and I got Reisling with my spinach lasagna.  The dishes came piping hoy and cheesy.   The hubby's ziti was the perfect texture, sauce amoubt and crispy cheese was amazing.  My loaded spinach lasagna was firm, full of spichach and covered in cheese.  I have to say the salad and wine were noyhing spectacular but functional.   The garlic toast was soft and buttery as well.  The service was adequate; perhaps a little slow even though it wasn't super busy.  The biggest complaint the live musician who was a good background music piano player but when he sang it was embarrassing.   He wad not good.  Would have been had he not sung at all.  Otherwise it was a terrific Friday night dinner out.",,,,,,

You must request them...then they only bring a few. Last time it was served on a very hot plate...by the time we got the toast, some if the carpaccio was cooked. Horrible.\n\nI have enjoyed the venison dish in the past...it was always tender and succlent. Last visit, it was so rare and chewey I could not enjoy it. I asked the waitress about it, and she replied, \""They've always cooked it rare\"". \n\nThe crab cakes: I know that most German menus probably don't include crab cakes! But, most nice restaurants do, so it is pretty standard fare. Their crab cakes are very crabby, but also include either tuemeric or curry, which is entirely unexpected, and does not add to the dish.\n\nTheir famous salad: The Waldhorn salad, baby greens towering over delicious cucumber salad, orzo salad, carrot salad and delicious german potato salad. This dish is just amazing! For us, it is the only reason to return to Waldhorn's!\n\nBring your own water, service is spotty most times....and I've observed that we aren't always the only ones with empty glasses!\n\nWe've liked Waldhorn for over 10 years....but this weekend was probably our last visit.",,,,,,
1,I wasn't familiar with this small chain until I traveled to the Southwest last year.  Elephant Bar was a welcome find when I visited one near Albuquerque last December.  The menu is diverse ranging from salads to sandwiches to stir fry to entrees.  I have tried a selection from each of the menu sections and I have always enjoyed my food at the Elephant Bar.\n\nStaff is trained well and very informed about the menu choices.  I like the casual atmosphere of each Elephant Bar and I find them good for lunch meetings.\n\nManager Leo at this Scottsdale location is welcoming and attentive to details throughout the restaurant.  Elephant Bar is along something of a restaurant row on Mayo.  Parking is plentiful and the restaurant is easy to find off of Scottsdale Road.,,,,,,

1,"My mom has been a regular at Ide Mania for years and also takes my 17 year old brother with curly hair there, but they don't Yelp.  She absolutely loves this place so it's always the go-to place for gift certificates for her birthday, Mother's Day, and Christmas.  My family was even nice enough to get me a gift certificate which I was used for an amazing 1-hour spa pedicure and a bunch of products.  Every time I've gone in there for gift certificates, to stop in and say Hi to my Mom while she's getting her hair done, or for products they've always been so funny, warm, professional and nice.\n\nMy mom and brother who go there both have curly hair and Lettie knows exactly what to do and how to make their hair look the way they want.   My 17 year old brother has been able to grow out his curly hair from short to about to a little above the shoulders, but it's cut/shaped really well so it always looks really good even between haircuts.",,,,,,
1,"Buffet only on Friday!! And today is Wednesday :*(\n\nI went based on other yelp reviews, and it was pretty good.\n\nNot gourmet or anything, and it is a grocery store, but I tend to like this sort of thing and feel more at home, like you're at someone's house at the table in the kitchen.\n\nI got the gyro plate with a few salads on the side.  It's reasonably priced and they serve it with warm pita bread.\n\nNext time I will ask for more salads and less meat (just my personal preference), but everything was tasty. And the tsatziki sauce was yum yum yum.\n\nI'll come back on Friday and check out the buffet.  (Only 12-4!)",,,,,,
-1,"As a new yelper, I feel the need to span the star spectrum, but I really had a hard time trying to think of a 1.  Then I remembered a little voyage I took last fall, coupon in hand, to Zoe's, which is right between my apartment and work.  The coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase.  Thank God I had that coupon, becuase I would have been pissed if I had actually payed $7.50 for a \""spinach quesadilla\"" which was cream cheese and cooked spinach between two tortillas.  I could have made it better for $.45 at home.  \nThen I actually went back again to give it a second chance (I had a lot of coupons) and ate a very boring sandwich with cafeteria stlye mashed potatoes.   Maybe this place would be better for non vegetarians....my coworker liked his Greek Chicken plate, (liked, not loved)....it may go up to 2 or 3 stars for carnivores.",,,,,,
-1,"I went with a party of four, and was the only one not to order the chicken fried steak - - rather, my heart was set on chicken fried chicken.  Now, I'm not a gravy person, so I ordered my chicken w/o gravy.  This was the most flavorless piece of fried chicken I've ever eaten.  The breading had ZERO seasoning in it, and the chicken was not seasoned.  While it was moist, it required generous amounts of tabasco to make it edible.  What a let down.  The buttermilk biscuit was good...and that was all I'd describe as above average.",,,,,,
-1,"This is a very odd restaurant.  I was here once and probably won't be back.  The people who work here were doing a lot of screaming at each other, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant but our food took about 45 minutes to come, and the quality of the food wasn't that great.  You can definitely get better Vietnamese elsewhere in the city.\n\nWith all the wonderful dining options in the Strip, I'm confused as to how this place survives.",,,,,,
-1,"Get ready to walk or run, whichever. I have flown in and out of CLT about 1000 times, usually on a connection. CLT is very large, and you will use about 10 moving sidewalks, and escalators. They do have nice rocking chairs spread throughout, however I doubt you will have time to lavish the slow life. The food is okay at best, mostly fast food, as all airports. \n\nThe 2 stars for me comes from the massive delays on the runway. You WILL sit on the airplane in a big huge line waiting to take off, or you will wait for an open gate for your plane to park. That gets annoying. In addition, the runways are really long, so it makes for a LONG taxi. \n\nI always joke and say when you are flying from CLT you will feel like the plane is driving to the destination not flying.",,,,,,

1,"Let's start with THIS is my playground. It's a frickin gym. Nothing special. It's centrally located, clean and available to me at all the hours I want to go bully the weights. I am not into the classes (explains the one star deficit), but will tell you everything you need to know about kicking the weights around. The weights are plenty though some machines could get more maintenance upkeep due to their popularity, ie the leg machines. The rows of cardio machines are plenty for those of you looking to up your heart rate. Though with the mix of hot yuppies, uber models, beefcakes, the eye candy around is enough motivation to work out without being bored. It is located in the Biltmore/Arcadia area...what do you expect? My fave room is the ab room which has a variety of equipment for you to work on your core and spacious enough without being violated by your neighbor's sweat or wandering eyes. I like that the bathrooms are on the lower level from the rest of the gym so it's not like I have to do a runway walk to change into my gymrat gear. Lockers are readily available with easy access to the sauna, steam room and lap pools. Warning, the hot tub is a hotbed for really bad pick up lines. \n\nLike anywhere else, the busy days and peak times you may find yourself waiting on benches or machines. The gym could have updates here and there but the staff is good about addressing issues. I feel like the cleaning crew is always ensuring spotlessness, in fact they work out there too! The trainers are all friendly and approachable as are the patrons if you need to ask about any equipment use or suggestions on varying your routine. For the monthly membership, I have no complaints.",,,,,,
-1,"disappointing.\n\nserver was nice and pretty attentive but that's about all good i can say about this place.\n\nwe ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks that were pretty decent but nothing to rave over.  while we were still eating them, our tomato basil soup arrived so i had to juggle which one i wanted to eat before they got cold.  it turns out, i didn't much care for the soup so that was an easy choice.\n\nmid-way through the appetizer/soup course, viola!  our main course arrived.  i admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to get food before i'm ready for it.. so that's a big part of why this restaurant is not my favorite.\n\nhowever, the dishes we got weren't particularly good either.\ni got the spinach chicken ravioli with marinara on three and alfredo on the other three.  the chicken didn't seem quality and it was stuck in the raviolis in chunks and it distracted from the consistency of it as a dish.\n\nmy beau's steak was inedible.  his first bite was gristle -- so much so that he had to spit it back out.  he only managed to gnaw through half the steak .. and i think he did that only because he was so hungry.  he asked for it medium-rare and it came so rare that, if it was me, i would have definitely sent it back to be cooked more.\n\noverally, i was just disappointed by benvenuto's.  \nbummer.",,,,,,

-1,"We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say, the best part was the complimentary valet parking!  We arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm, thinking the restaurant would be packed, only to find it about a quarter full.  Did we go to the right place?  From what I had heard, I expected there to be a line out the door like there was both times we went to Chima for past Restaurant Weeks.  It's a nice looking place, very open yet cozy, and it has a great bar area.  The server, John, was great and took good care of us, so no complaints there.  It was the food that was lackluster, and for the money, I wish we had gone elsewhere.  The bread was fresh and a good start (2 kinds, and a spread with olives as well as an oil and balsamic vinaigrette to wet it down). The Fattouch salads were good, though I question the use of iceberg lettuce for presentation as it looked like a low end salad with some red peppers, olives and a nasty tomato thrown in.  My partner had a Flat Iron Steak which he ordered medium well and got medium rare.  The first few bites were good, but it toughened as it cooled, and he had some difficulty cutting it as well as the asian broccoli (which he gave up on).  Being a vegan, I wasn't sure I would find anything to eat, but i did see a Mushroom Bolognese pasta dish that I ended up ordering.  It had a great taste, but the homemade pasta was a bit al dente and stuck together.  More like the wide rice noodles in some asian dishes.  Still, I enjoyed mine.  No vegan desert option for me (fresh fruit option, please?), but my partner ordered the chocolate cake and said it was good but very rich.  It all seemed to disappear, though, so that says something!  Overall, a decent dining experience, if we were spending maybe $40-50 max, tip included.  $30 each plus 2 iced teas ($6.98) and tip came to just under $90.  At least I felt like I got my one's worth with the valet at $5 for a tip, it saved me $1 off parking myself and then walking a block!  Still, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  With all the great dining our city has, I think there are better choices for the money...Ilios Noche comes to mind for great atmosphere, service and menu selection at about $20-25 less, and then we could still catch a movie!",,,,,,

They even told me it was the same company which is clearly not the case.\n\nArriving, the guy propose me all the insurance that I have to take. It increases the price of the renting by 3... (400$ to +1200$) So from cheap prices AMEX told me, I got a 3 times higher bill now.\n\nNot that I am not aware of this kind of situation but in the case of Enterprise, there will be a difference when you arrive to the car. National use to give for the same price a middle to full car size. Enterprise will just give you a small car you \""asked\"" for for the small price which is now with the insurance a full size car price.\n\nWe also wanted to change the credit card used to pay. Call Enterprise desk put on hold forever. Send an e-mail to the leasing agent that gave me his card, never got an answer.\n\nThe car didn't have any problem. Only positive thing.\n\nSo for resume:\nFor the National price, you get at Enterprise a small car with no people willing to help you once you swiped your credit card.",,,,,,

Maybe I am spoiled....the zoo I grew up going to \""Reid Park Zoo\"" in Tucson is 20 times better!\n\nThe animal selection was pathetic. The only thing that impressed me was the enclosures are large, which is great for the animals, but the variety is lacking. I do not recommend going during the afternoon on a hot day. The animals were all hiding and sleeping to avoid the heat.\n\nBring your own food/water!!! This place is GOUGING it's guests!! $3 for a bottle of soda!!!! The prices for the snack bars are astronomical! $6 for a HOT DOG! OUCH!\n\nI do not have plans of ever going back to this zoo, from now on I will take the 100 mile trip to Tucson, and will likely end up spending LESS (with gas included) than at the Phoenix Zoo.",,,,,,
-1,"we are familiar with Popey's (West coast version of this restaurant) so we thought, great! Landed late at the airport, let's go get some of their famous Dirty Rice, Fried chicken and fixings.  When we finally reached the order box at the drive through order station, the young lady's voice kept cutting in and out of the speaker.  We thought :\""well there must be something wrong with the microphone or their speaker box and continued on to pay. As we reached the payment window a man was at the window asking for $7 for the supreme meal, we said, \""no, we ordered the 12pc chicken with dirty rice, you know your supreme package with all the fixings.  He walks away waves his hand and yells at someone to come take the order right, this young african american comes up, asks why we dont want the supreme meal box and continually shuts the service window on us as we are trying to tell her we ordered the family meal. She turns around slams the window shut again and throws her hands up and walks off with this attitude!  Never comes back or to tell us what the price of the meal is going to be...she just abandoned us at the pick up window!

-1,"I agree with another poster on the review about Village Pizza being compared to Dominos. I have to say tag lines of \""Real Italian Food\"" caught my eye and sparked my interest. unfortunately, I was let down. There is nothing authentically Italian about this eatery. Staff was upbeat and nice , pizza buffet was sparse and pizza looked old. It was right around dinner time , so if anything, that's when the buffet should  be stocked with choices.  We ordered a pizza with meatball and pepperoni, and a side of mozzarella sticks. Sauce was decent and sticks were good, toppings were fresh. It's convenient, if you live in the area, but I don't understand all the hype.",,,,,,
-1,"Light your torches and get the pitchforks, because I'm not shy about writing scathing reviews on some of Pittsburgh's beloved restaurants. I don't enjoy doing it.  I love our city and I think our diverse restaurant choices make us a great place to live and visit. But when I hear great things about a place only to be consistently let down, I have no choice.  That being said, I'm going to have to rip Harris Grill a new one. \n\nI waited a long time before reviewing Harris Grill.  I've been there loads of times; happy hours, bacon night, brunch, crowded Friday nights, and not-so-crowded Monday nights.  Almost every time I have been let down. \n\nI'll break it down. \n\nDRINKS: The drink menu and draft lift offer a solid list of (overpriced) choices.  That's fine.  What isn't so fine is that the bartending is inconsistent and I have too often received ill-concocted highballs and sangria that tastes like Franzia.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but almost every time I'm there at least one or two beer taps \""aren't working.\"" \n\nAPPETIZERS: Nothing really wrong here.  Good spinach and buffalo chicken dips, the \""Britney Spears\"" (chicken strips), and hummus are all very tasty. Thumbs up.\n\nMAIN COURSES: I guess it depends on your taste, but I am simply not enthralled by any of the entrees.  The salads are overpriced for their small size, their highly touted macaroni and cheese is bland, and their chicken quesadillas are NOT quesadillas.  Just about everything on the menu at Harris Grill is overpriced for the quality.  $17 dollars for homemade hamburger helper?  $16 for two fish tacos? \n\nI don't HATE anything on the Harris Grill menu.  Their entrees are between \""ok\"" and \""good.\"" Just overpriced.  I do enjoy the Henny Penny and as I said before, all of the appetizers.  I'd give them a 3-star review if it wasn't for the....\n\nSERVICE:  Or lack thereof.  Sure, Harris Grill gets crowded, especially on the weekends.  That does not excuse the waitstaff from being rude and ignoring their tables for upwards of an hour.  On one occasion, our server clearly forgot about us and we watched astounded as tables seated long after us were brought their meals.  When we finally did inquire about our food,  the waiter made a beeline for the computer to put in our orders.  No apologies, no offer to comp a side or a dessert.  In fact, the check was rushed to us before we even finished our food because the restaurant had a long waiting list.  Bad form, Harris Grill. What makes it worse is that I've been here many times, and have had similar problems with the service. \n\nBut truth be told, I'll probably be back.  Because I really want to like Harris Grill. Moreover, my friends love Harris Grill and I love my friends.  I just sincerely hope they hire more competent waitstaff.  Revising their menu wouldn't be a bad idea, either...",,,,,,

-1,"Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again.",,,,,,

-1,"Well Merc. You have let me and my friends down. I have gone to you over the years while living in the Biltmore/Arcadia area and  have recommended you time and time again to people who want a 'ultra lounge feel' as opposed to a 'club like feel'. Well. After arriving for happy hour last week we had the entire Merc Bar to ourselves at about 430pm and the bartender swiftly brought us a menu and waters. Nice! However, that awesome service went downhill fast and the decibel level of your 90's Culture Club and New Edition beats went way up at the same rate. Soon my two friends and I were yelling our conversation to each other! ' What?!! What?!!! OH right?!! ' Yes. I am not making this up. That music was loud & out of character for what I 'thought ' was a cool, swanky, hip, ittle ultra lounge. I'm thinking some jazz, maybe ?? Or at least some Michael Buble? At a level where your patrons can talk in a voice to each other that doesn't cause laryngitis the next day! We would eventually figure out as Merc began to fill up , that there was a group meeting here this particular day. There were so many, in fact, we could not make our way to the restroom without pushing thru physically. We never saw the cocktail waitress, and that meant we never got our waters refilled after that bartender brought us our initial glass. At any rate , our drink that our once attentive bartender gave us was called the Double A. It was a mix of tequila , grapefruit juice , raspberries , lemon and bitters. It was good! I won't deny that you have amazing fresh ingredient drinks made with premium liquors! That said, we would have stayed and ordered more , but the cocktail waitress had to be flagged down by going to the bar  , ( and fighting the Meet Up crowd again), and telling the bartender we wanted our bill. She came twenty minutes later and we were overcharged for our drinks. Fail. We went back to bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets! We felt that trying to 'fight' over a few bucks wasn't worth the effort of the crowd, the loud music and all of the frustration. Oh. MY. I give you a two based on your drink being unique and fresh and that is all. What you used to be, Merc Bar, I hope you can be again!",,,,,,

1,"This zoo just keeps getting better, and better. I've been to this zoo almost every other year since I was 4 years old. I'm 23 now.\n\nI'm planning another \""back to Arizona\"" trip, since I moved away from AZ for about 5 years, and missed AZ so much that I just HAD to come back. I went to the Kansas Zoo, and wow, was it HORRIBLE! There was next to nothing compared to the Phoenix Zoo. I remember going and hearing people say how Amazing it was, then after actually going to it, it made me miss and appreciate the Phoenix Zoo even more. \n\nThis place is huge, and has a really cute lay out. I don't know why so many people said it was a bad lay out, or not a good zoo. Everytime I've went, the animals were out and about. We even saw bear cubs wrestling with each other while the mother/father watched. A white bird kept saying \""hello pretty\"" to me, and \""no!\"" to my brother, hahaha.  \n\nThey now have the up close giraffe exhibit, as someone else mentioned. They never had that when I was growing up, so I'm really excited to go and see how that is.\n\nI give this zoo a 5/5 stars, because I've never once had a problem. For the people complaining about strollers, I completely agree but it's expected when people have so many kids now a days :( Makes it sort of hard for the ones that don't have kids to enjoy stuff when you have 5 kids and 3 strollers in front of you, or on your toes. \n\nThe gift shops are great! Sure, they may be a tad overpriced, but when are gift shops not over priced? Exactly.\n\nDon't forget zoo lights. I don't know of any other Zoo's that have it, but if you have a zoo with zoo lights, consider yourself lucky, and go to one immediately . If you don't have one, come to the Phoenix Zoo around Christmas time, and see the zoo lights. It's so pretty, and puts you in such a great Christmas mood. It definitely brings out the Christmas now a days, since most people don't seem to decorate or celebrate it as much, anymore =(",,,,,,
1,"I've been to a lot of airports and I have to say that I think Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is probably one of the most user friendly. They need to do some work in baggage claim, with better signage and maybe see what can be done to speed up luggage delivery, but the gate areas and shopping are pretty darn good. I like parking in the garage but it's a bit pricey for me and the economy lot parking shuttles are too slow for my taste. So I either get a ride or use an off airport parking lot as they seem to be faster. if you have a long lay over, there is plenty to keep you entertained while at Sky Harbor.",,,,,,

Then they took a huge vat of skim milk and burned the crap out of it and mixed it with water. They combined the two in my cup. I asked for less milk, hoping to be able notice some coffee flavor.

As for the people that shop here, if you stand too close, you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot. Every time I come here, without fail, there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter, trying to convince them they just \""lost\"" their written prescription for Vicodin, or their Percocets got \""stolen\"", all with Emmy-award winning shows of anguish and pain. So you're asking now why I even come here, and I don't blame you. I work long hours, and this is the closest 24-hour pharmacy to my humble abode.

The two people who were with me got their food, and I was still waiting, and waiting and waiting. Finally the waitress came over and asked if anyone had been here to talk to me...isn't that her job? She said that they gave my dish to someone else by accident, so they are making me a \""fresh\"" plate. \n\nMy enchiladas finally arrive, and look like they were just slopped on the plate. i take a bite and guess what? They were barely warm! You would think that a \""fresh\"" plate would be served piping hot! I took a few bites, but by now I was over them and late for a meeting. \n\nA waitress that was different than ours brought over our check, which included my enchiladas. I told her what the problem was, but she didn't seem to speak English very well and said she would go ask someone. They did take them off the bill, but that really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table were done with their food before I even got mine! \n\nThe decor is odd too, it is like they are trying to be a sports bar, but maybe aren't sure, evidenced by the 6 plasma TVs sitting in the corner still in their boxes! \n\nIf I have a say in the matter....I won't be returning to Deemos.",,,,,,
1,"First off, like what Daren below me wrote, there are 2 Casey Jones's. One offers up free UFC, and this one offers up an incredible local beer selection , and some decent food to go along with it. \n\nIt's a sports bar, and it does it well. And they carry everything, including stuffed pizza sticks, nachos, and my personal favorite, fried cheese curds.\n\nYes, fried cheese curds. Balls of wonder. \n\nGo for the beer, the tv's, and trivia on Thursdays. \n\nParking is horrific.",,,,,,
-1,"Tried takeout yesterday. One of the worst Indian meals we have had in a long time.\n- Lamb Kabobs - undercooked and falling apart. They may have run out of time or maybe they had too many takeout orders. No excuse. A big F for this.\n- Chicken Makhni - C minus. tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish. Very small portion. \n- Saag Paneer - C+ The paneer tasted rubbery. Good flavor though.\n\nOne can understand, this is Charlotte and thus not a Indian food destination. But the miss on simple Kabobs clearly show a careless staff. Charlotte deserves better.\n\nIn my opinion, a waste of money.",,,,,,
-1,"This place is slimey as all heck & a disgrace to the KIA brand.  I chose to go to this dealership because I was under the pretense of a false trade-in promotion.  Their claimed minimum trade-in value does not pertain to the vast majority of their car lot. Their selection is extremely weak (they only carrying a handful of each model).  \n\nIn the last decade I've purchased cars from the Independence Carmax (twice), Scott Clark Toyota & Hilbush Ford.  I prefer all of them over Folger Kia.",,,,,,
1,"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants that reminds me a lot of the little Italian family style restaurants you can find in little Italy and other places around NYC. I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!",,,,,,
1,"While visiting family in Mesa for the week, my husband and I decided to spend one (rare) rainy afternoon going bowling. A quick Internet search led us to AMF Lanes. Though the reviews weren't stellar, we are far from bowling alley connoisseurs so we were confident that this place would meet our needs. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it well exceeded expectations! The price was very reasonable, only $8 for all you can bowl until 5:00! The woman working the counter was extremely friendly and helpful too. Dan the bartender (and fellow northerner, Michigan to be exact but we don't hold that against him), was quick with our beers and enjoyable to talk to. He even made rounds over to the lanes to check on the bowlers and to ask if they needed anything. The place was clean, played fun music, and had a nice afternoon crowd but was not overly packed. All in all it was a fun and affordable activity and we definitely plan to return when we are back in town. Thanks AMF Mesa Lanes!",,,,,,
-1,"Never been treated so poorly\n\nI went with three friends to eat at Tessaro's on a rainy Saturday evening.  I dropped them off while I parked the car.  The hostess  sat them and when she found out I was parking the car, she told them literally to \""GET UP.\""  She said they wouldn't seat them because I wasn't there.  By that time I had arrived at the table  my friends were still in shock by the utter rudeness.  Tessaro's was a Pittsburgh institution that my family had frequented for years.  Our treatment is a disgrace to its reputation",,,,,,

-1,"Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.\n\nI had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \""difficult\"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \""Locks of Love,\"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.\n\nI watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \""wasn't looking right.\""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\n\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \""I have to leave, so sorry \""as I bolted for the door.",,,,,,
1,"No alterations! Nicht!\nI have out-of-town guests and always like them to experience the wonderful food and service at the Rokerij. I was craving my favorite Carne Adovada (pork roast dish), however I usually replace the rice and beans with some of their fresh seasonal vegetables. Not this time! Apparently the kitchen can't handle changing out sides (as of a couple months ago). So had to completely switch gears and figure out a new direction very quickly as rice & beans are not my friends. \nAs expected the meal was delightful but still craving my Carne!!",,,,,,

1,"Food and service is excellent! Salsa is fresh and delicious and the guac is equally delicious with a hint of jalape\u00f1o. They must've included a bit of jalapeno in the fajita veggies in my chicken quesadillla because my mouth was craving milk.  Our server brought my hubby a free fried ice cream since it was his birthday. :)  They also have gave me 2 free dinners for buying over $30 in gift certificates.  We loved Jessie, our server!  However, they don't have jalape\u00f1o cream cheese and the women's bathroom is old and little gross.  Just go to the bathroom elsewhere.",,,,,,

They were made to order and they were good!  They were so fresh too! I had the Chicken salad on Multi-grain bread. Yummy, can't wait to stop in again for one.  And the full sandwich was $2.99 ( w/o cheese). \n\nMaybe I will shop here after all from time to time.",,,,,,

1,"Man, I am going to miss Krua when I move back to Washington. I was pretty convinced the Southwest just didn't understand Thai food the way the West coast did, but I've been proven wrong. I'm updating my review because I finally got the chance to eat inside. I love the decor! It's just a small hidden place but it really is worth eating inside.\n\nI started with a water and a sweet Thai iced tea. I've never had anything like it! Super sweet and served with heavy cream on top. When stirred, the whole drink turns a bright orange. It was a really nice contrast to what we ordered..\n\nPineapple fried rice. Shrimp panang curry. Tofu pad thai. Veggie spring rolls. Get ready to say the Lord's name in vain, because that's all I can really do when I eat food from here. It's just great. I love the pad thai especially because it isn't overly greasy or soupy at all. The tofu was really good, pan-fried to perfection. And I like it hot! Even at a mere 'medium' spice it was burning my palate. The veggie rolls were meatless and were made with lots of pepper counteracted by the sweet and sour sauce. Steaming hot, extra-crisp. Great big portions make for plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nThe service is quick and the man who always seems to be working is so so friendly. We got pretty cold from a breeze coming in, and he even closed the door. \n\nI don't care what you Thai purists have to say... I get around when it comes to pad thai and this place is duking it out in my heart for first.",,,,,,

-1,"Maybe I'm spoiled, but coming from Orlando to Charlotte, going to Carowinds was an eye-opener for me.  It made me remember just how much care is put into theme parks by Disney and Universal.   They don't put a lot of effort into theming, landscaping, or guest service at Carowinds, but they do throw some rides your way.  \n\nAs rides go, the rides are okay here at Carowinds, somewhere between a carnival and the theme parks in Orlando.  The old wooden Hurler roller coaster didn't make me want to hurl, but it did make me wish I was wearing a crash helmet.  My head felt like a martini -- shaken and stirred.  Some of the other rides felt like rides I used to go on as a kid; they haven't been updated.  \n\nAs for their food options, they're not great.  We waited awhile for below average theme park fare.  And don't even get me started with the guy who wanted to run off with our credit card to ask his manager something when we wanted to buy a soda.  That was 15 minutes of my life that I'd like back.  \n\nWhat does Carowinds have going for it?  Its proximity to Charlotte and an option for something to do for a day during the summer.  Other than that, save your money and go to Orlando.",,,,,,
-1,"I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.\n\nAfter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \""apologize\"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \""never salt his steak again\"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \n\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \n\nOverall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.",,,,,,
1,"No Ka Oi (#1!) plate lunch in the desert!  Lived on fresh, inexpensive plate lunch when I lived on Oahu and the Big Island, and Moki's fits the bill.  I had the Ahi Plate lunch with white rice, and a spinach salad side.  The salad was non-traditional, but oh so good!  The fish rocked, and the rice had a nice touch of salt and sugar.  Very good.  Wife had the Kahlua Pork Plate Lunch, and that was equally good.  We live near San Tan Village, but will make the trip to Moki's regularly due to the quality, quantity, and authenticity.  I told you when I was there, and I'll say it again:  YOU GUYS ROCK!!  Aloha.",,,,,,
1,"Celebrity is one of the better concert venues in the valley.  Sometimes the stage revolves and other times they do a 3/4 house show and it doesn't.  Either way, good place to see a show.  The bar downstairs is decent, friendly bartenders.  Dodge is probably my favorite venue but for smaller or mid sized concerts/acts this is the place.",,,,,,
-1,"These people were so unbelievably rude to me. They were rude on the phone, they were rude when I picked my order up. I am not going back even though the food was good, not worth being treated like you are the smallest person in the world.

1,"A friend of mine and I have been going here for lunch for a while. Our tradition would include escaping from school/work on Mondays and meeting up here for lunch. The coffee is good, the pastries are great, and the food is excellent. They used to have this iced tea there (but seemed to have swapped it for something else as of late) that was unbelievable. We called it the \""Tea of Freedom.\"" It tasted like a promising adventure awaiting you just around the corner. Stop laughing! It was really damn good iced tea. But just as it came into my life, it was gone just as elusively.\n\nThe owners are accommodating and charming. On slow days we would see him sitting outside with a demitasse of espresso and reading French newspaper, only to hop to his feet when we walked in. \n\nIt does appear the prices have gone up, and they're approaching steepness for a cafe, but this is the Biltmore after all. \n\nHighlight: Don't know what to get? Ask for a recommendation. You won't be sorry.",,,,,,
-1,"This place is awful.  The pizza is not good, but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad, they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it, I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone.",,,,,,

-1,"Used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through Madison. We generally aim more for Country Inn or Hampton... but this was the best deal.  At check-in I was told they only had king beds left,  though the parking lot was quite empty.  When we got to the room there were no sheets for the hide-a-bed. We went to the front desk and asked for some. We were told that the security guard would bring them up. 45 minutes later (it was close to 12:30 am at this point) we had to call and remind them. \n\nThe room was pretty rough. Lots of ding marks on the doors and trims. The light over the mirror didn't work. Things were just worn out.  The bed had clearly seen better days.  Crowne gives you these silly \""relax packs\"" with aroma therapy stuff.  A good bed would do more for making me relaxed. \n\nIn general I wasn't impressed.  We'll stick with Country Inn & Hampton inns.",,,,,,
1,"I'm not sure where the negative reviews come from.  We've been coming here for years (probably 50-60 total meals) and I can only think of one or two experiences that were just mediocre and none that were bad.\n\nThis place amazes me, because it's one of the few buffet places where the food is actually consistently good and fresh.  Many of their dishes are always served, but they also do rotational dishes based around specific themes for limited times.  That keeps the menu from getting stale. \n\nThe salad bar is long enough for the 100 yard dash and the veggies and all the accompanying toppings are countless and plentiful in quantity.\n\nThe salad bar is just the starter.  They also have a hot food stations that serve rotating dishes of various pasta, sweet and baked potatoes, pizza, multiple breads and muffins, desserts, drinks, and a 6-7 choice soup bar that's outstanding!  Their soups are very good and made in-house.\n\nWhat I like best is the value.  You can find coupons for different deals, but we use the Family Meal Deal that feeds 2 adults and 2 kids for a flat $19.99 + drinks.  You can't find a better selection of healthy choices anywhere for less.\n\nIf you go to Sweet Tomatoes expecting a Michelin star dining experience, you will be disappointed.  If you expect lots of good, fresh dining options at a great price, you will be pleased with your choice to eat here.\n\nTIP: If you plan on visiting regularly, try to get the kids drink cups.  They offer free refills on future visits.",,,,,,
1,I love coming here for happy hour when I'm in town.  $5 glasses of wine between 11 am - 5 pm everyday.  Nice selection of reds/whites to choose from.  They also have delicious paninis and bruschetta.  Their desserts are also really yummy!  Everything is reasonably priced.  The outdoor patio makes the food and wine even more enjoyable.,,,,,,

1,I've been eating here for at least 15 years. And I must say its probably the only thai restaurant in the phoenix area that I will always return to. The food is tasty and consistent. I've tried many of the surrounding thai restaurants and most of them leave a lot to be desired. Thai Lana makes really good food. I recommend. Shrimp with chillis and mint I think is number 45 or 46 its tastey and I usually ask for one notch below thai hot so its hot but not so hot. Also I recommend the yellow or red curry. Coconut flavour and never watery just the rite amount coconut and spice. The portions are addiquete. I usually oder these two plates and invariably I always have some ledt over to take home.  A friend that is very much a steak and potatoes guy. He dosent care much at all for thai food. He really likes thai lana. In fact its been his suggestion that we dine here on our two most recent visits. The ony con I can think of is that they don't have brown rice. If they had brown rice I would give them 5 stars,,,,,,
-1,"This is my second time coming to this location in a month. Its right there w/ where I regularly get gas during lunch. You would think that w/ it being right next to Carowinds and its the summertime that it would be faster during lunch time . \n\nToday's visit was not any different. They only had one person taking orders at 12:30 and the drive thru had like 4 cats waiting for orders to be taken. Workers behind the counter didn't know what people ordered so they were confused. \n\nIf this place wasn't connected to the gas station I like to use, I would go across the street to Subway or drive 5 min more to the McDs when I want a burger.  I mean prime location and they're taking advantage of people they know will come here because of their location.",,,,,,

We ordered seaweed salad - I think my frys has better salad for $2; my daughter ordered California rolls - very average; the pad Thai was as bland as I have ever had and the calamari was over fried and zero flavor - no wonder they offer  sauce. Kids liked the cinnamon flavored bread so that accounts for one star.,,,,,,
-1,"There's a reason why this place has no reviews.  It's never open...not even at 6:30 pm on a Thursday.  Even though the sign said \""Open\"" and the door was open.

1,"Unlike most eateries in Phoenix where often I take on a \""willfully blind\"" approach to service/ambiance,etc, I actually felt as though I was not in Phoenix the moment I arrived in this dark toned jewel of a restaurant.  Simply put, the dining experience exceeded any expectations I had for the evening.  Gorgeous stemware perfectly complimented a very understated and meticulously considered wine list.  Upon the arrival of my main course, I suffered through slobber fits while awaiting the rest of the tables food (momentary wait).  The Surf n Turf (dungeness crab enchiladas, bacon wrapped jumbo prawns, delicious mashed potatoes, and perfectly cooked piece of beef - $29) - was served on girthy plates framed by an artfully presented dish.  Healthy portions, overflowing flavor and subtly attentive service catapulted the Rokerij to the top of my Valley favorites.  If a single dining experience could suggest of more delectably similar experiences to come, this was it!  Every meal at the table was equally as well received as mine and I don't think you'll find a better salad than the Rokerij concoction we partook in prior to the main course...simply put, a superlative dining experience from start to finish!  \n\nI can't wait to return for their \""small plate\"" and $7 glass of wine happy hour.",,,,,,
1,"Had a blast at this spot ( and not just because i whooped my b/f's ass either on the track..bhahaha)\n\nanywho, we signed up and became members cheaper to do it that way if you think you will get the urge to race often. Member is $14 and some change and non member is $20. You sign up, pick a racing name that will permanently been yours forever and eva.. ( Sexyspeeder, right here :) ) you get a head sock you will have to wear under the Helmet, free t-shirt if you sign up also.  LADIES wear closed toe shoes... i had to borrow some of there's and lets just say i never want to wear rental shoes again.\n\nYou can race as much as you want, take breaks in between or do back to back if you choose. On Sundays they combine the tracks together so its an even longer track. it was really fun, those little karts go pretty fast ( and they do take bumping very seriously..they will pull your grown ass over and scold you like a little kid if they catch you..i know cause they gave my b/f a talkin too) they keep track of your best lap and which place you came in and you get a paper that records all this... my #1 is plastered on the refrigerator! whoop whoop.\n\nIf your looking for some competitive fun, try this place out.

I would imagine that if you went there in the afternoon you could have an enjoyable happy hour on the patio, but don't go anywhere near this place after 10.",,,,,,
-1,"Service was horrible from the start. We waited for an eternity just to get menus. There was even a wait after I personally had to ask them to bring us menus. The waitress said they are very busy but the place was at 40% capacity. I understand if things are going slow but the amount of time before we even got our menus was a little ridiculous.\n\nSecond biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time. We had a party of 6 and 4 menus came out, before the next 2. Only 4 waters came out, before the best 2. All of our burgers came out at different times. Also, between each visit from our waitress, there is a long wait.\n\nNow the food. I got the California burger with onions rings. The burger was extremely bland, you hardly notice there is guacamole, bacon or basically anything. I'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty. Only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings. Today they had half off burgers, which is the only reason why anyone should try their burgers. At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.\n\nIt's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...\n\nIf you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday. I'm thoroughly disappointed.",,,,,,
-1,I've only been here twice. It's a very cheap place to have a drink. Which is good.\n\nThey must not make enough money to run the A/C because it is so hot in there and they have a big fan running instead. \n\nThe pizza I had didn't impress me. It tastes like cheese substitute that comes from a bag. \n\nThe bar is very dated and not in a charming divey way but in an economically depressed way. The bar feels dirty and I imagine it looks worse with bright lights. Good thing it's dark.\n\nI never come here and I won't likely be a regular.,,,,,,
-1,"Boy, I don't know.  I went alone at around 3:00 in the afternoon on a Wednesday.  I was famished and didn't want to search the area for a place to grab a bite so I gave the place a try.\nI ordered the chicken pad tai - thinking it would be a safe bet.  Honestly, it tasted like the cook was trying to get rid of some leftover food from the lunch hour.  I did like the crunchy bean sprouts - the only thing that gave the dish any texture at all.  Mixed in were the asian style noodles I expected and also spagetti.  They were both like mush from overcooking.  Though I ordered chicken, I found very little but there was loads of tofu in the dish which I wasn't expecting.  Also - the food was very bland.  Not a hint of kick to it at all.  I may have just come at a bad time, but I don't think I'll go back.",,,,,,

They don't buy what you think they should buy, they look like they think they are better than you, and no their store isn't amazing. But you need to be honest and look at what is really going on. First, it is a thrift store, they aren't going to pay you what you paid for the item. Second, they are buying what they think their customers will buy (really it is what THEY like and would buy so look at who is sorting your stuff). Third, they work at...Buffalo Exchange...that is their level, so the little bit of power to either accept or reject you IS their big moment and they take is seriously.\n\nWalk in there expecting your \""rags\"" to be rejected and when one gets accepted be excited for your $5. I watched who shopped there, it was NOT cool, young, hip, or thin people. And I watched them sort through bags of middle aged women's clothing and buy some stuff I would never wear. Then I watched them reject True Religion jeans and some very expensive career pants. They won't wear that and they feel their customers won't either. It isn't personal, at least for you it shouldn't be, they aren't rejecting you, just your cool, expensive, designer clothes.",,,,,,
-1,"Phoenix Zoo employee Brandon (white male in his 20s). who was working the front gate called me a Dick. \n\nYou are not gonna believe this, I'm still in shock. Worst interaction with any employee ever. \nMy mother was visiting here from out of town and we decided to take my 2 1/2 year old my mom and myself to the Phoenix Zoo today.\nWe got there at noon and purchase the Wild Ride bands.  We spent all day at the zoo and were exhausted at the end of the day. It was 5PM and the zoo was closing so we were making our way to the exit. I had my 2 1/2 yr old daughter in a wagon and had pulled her around the zoo, I've been to the zoo several times and know that they want most traffic to exit through the gift shop but I didn't want to lug around my wagon into the gift shop, instead I preferred to exit through the entrance so I made my way towards the entrance to exit.  There was one young guy standing right in the middle of the gates and he said to me are you looking for the exit and I said well I want to exit here instead of going through the gift shop because I don't want to roll this wagon through there and he responded sorry you have to this is not an exit. I wasn't turning around though so I kept walking toward the left side of the gate, he was still standing in the middle of the section and said you can't exit here and I said, well listen this gate here opens can you just open it? (I waited for him to come over and offer to help but he stood fast where he was and said no)\nWhen I realized he wasn't going to accommodate I started to work the latch and I said it opens this way right (pulling instead if pushing)? he says No, then I pushed and it opened and he said it opens that way.\n(At this point I wasn't mad, just wanted to leave). As I opened the gate and rolled through I said I am not going through the gift shop with my daughter and this wagon, when you have kids you'll understand, to which he replied; \""maybe you should learn how to say no.\"" I stopped in my tracks and turned to him (still leaning against the turn style) and I said \""Maybe you should mind your own business.\"" Then I turned around again and heard; \""maybe you shouldn't be such a Dick.\"" WOW I was really speechless that an employee would say something like that in front of my child!!!! Of course physical contact is out of the question so I said \""do you like working here because today's your last day buddy.\""\nHe looked and rolled his eyes, I said get your manager out here right now and he said \""No.\"" So I noticed his radio was sitting on the gate right in front if him so I walked up to grab it and he said oh no and took it. I turned around looking for someone and no one was there so I started to call the zoo on my cell phone and just then an employee was walking in the office and I waved her down from the outside she came out and I explained what just happened and the she said OK hold on and went back in to return moments later with a supervisor, I didn't catch her name but she came out and shook my hand and introduced herself. \nI explained what just happened and she looked at the employee and waited for his response.  He said I walked up and asked for him to open the gate and then I just opened the gate and walked out. He totally denied everything after that and didn't admit anything! Crazy right?!\nI've gotta say in hindsight this supervisor didn't handle this effectively. The first thing she started to explain to me was their gate/exit policy saying how they do ask all guests to exit thru the gift shop and that the only reason the entrance gate is open is because of the fire code...I kind of interrupted her and said \""you don't have to explain that to me...\"" Then just asked what's your policy if a guest insists on exiting here are you required to allow it and she said yes. OK then that's end of story this guy did nothing and was very inappropriate and she said \""well this is a he said she said and we will have a talk with him. \""\nWhen I got home I told my wife what happened and she was furious, she said you paid to have a good experience there and an employer was not only rude to you for no reason but used bad language in front of your child and no one apologized to you or offered you anything. What kind of experience is that???\nSo I decided that first I need to notate what happened so I don't forget, second I am going to place a call tomorrow to the park manager and discuss what took place.\nI was real exhausted today and just wanted to leave and didn't take the time to think about how I should of handled this.\n\nUpdate to this review:\nI called the Zoo Tuesday morning and left a message for Jennifer which is Janelles supervisor but she never called me back, so I called the zoo Wed and asked for Jannelles boss Bonnie and left her a msg in the AM and no one called back. If I hear something I will update this review.",,,,,,

1,"The food was really really good and the prices were very reasonable so a definite 2 thumbs up for me.  We had the Chicken Soulveka (?spelling), the Mandarin Chicken Salad, and the pita chips.  Everything tasted really fresh.  But the best thing was the Pita Pizza because our 7 year old and 5 year old both loved it.   The reason we gave them 5 stars was that the staff was really nice and made great suggestions.  The location is great because it's right next to Harkins Theatres; we just found out that they have a Dinner and a Movie promotion.  We'll definitely be back !  NOTE: I just read the 1 star comments and I believe that they are under new management so give them a try.",,,,,,
-1,"My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. \n\nOnce we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. \n\nOh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience.",,,,,,

-1,"I was in the market for a black floral embossed belt (no giant buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly support a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).\n\nI walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more \""attention grabbing\"" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).\n\nI don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no.",,,,,,
-1,"Tom's Diner is one of those places I really, really want to like. You see it when driving down the street and it looks like a cool, retro place that got picked up from the past and dropped in the present next to the chain stores and abandoned buildings lining the rest of the street. If only the experience here matched the charming exterior.\n\nI don't have a problem with the diner food, first of all; it's not great, but hey, for cheap eats, it's not bad. They make a mean French onion soup, I admit. \n\nMy problem is more with the maintenance of the place. The windows are dirty, seats are busted, tables aren't properly cleaned - those things really detract from the experience and make the place look run-down and a bit unwelcoming.\n\nThe biggest offense for me, though? The service. My waitress? It took her three trips to remember I had ordered an additional drink (yes, we reminded her), by which time I was almost done with my meal. Also: this diner does not have ketchup at its tables. This would be okay if the servers remembered to bring it out with all meals. They do not. \n\nSeriously, guys: you operate in Pittsburgh. Ketchup is mandatory.\n\nI may poke in for a quick bite again, but I'll be honest with my final opinion: considering how mediocre my experience was on a slow Saturday night, I suspect some fast food chains could knock Tom's out of the park on a busy day at this diner.",,,,,,
-1,"I gave Moto a few tries because it was the closest sushi place to where I was living (would get it for take out).

Wish I could them better, but not impressed.",,,,,,
-1,"This place has a variety of exotic drinks and chocolates but it is kinda pricey. I could have gotten better chocolates at that price elsewhere because theirs taste like Hershey's.

So, I can't study or do research while in there.",,,,,,
1,"Oddly enough I only came to this location after visiting the new Gilbert location. Have to say I think I like the Gilbert locale better and I'm almost a little sick hearing myself say that. Not sure what was up with the rap music on this visit as I am in love with the music at the other locations. Not a great fan of the valet either as they don't seem to know how to dive manual cars or operate emergency  brakes. \n\nSo, I'm giving this location 4 stars based on the whole concept and the food (and assuming it will be better next time) but in my heart it gets 3 stars.",,,,,,
-1,Too expensive for what it is.  I had the ham and cheese flat this morning and it was the worst breakfast sandwich I have ever had in my whole entire life!!!  The ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese. I will certainly never go back for a breakfast sandwich.,,,,,,
1,Quaint place close to downtown. After touring the heard museum we headed over here in search of authentic mexican food. The food was indeed delicious! They also had a selection of home made cookies and rolls and things like that in the 'bakery' section. My friend was absolutely in love with their salsa which you can buy in an 8 oz. portion for I believe 3 or 4.99 or something like that. I was a little concerned when the person ordering in front of us had their order taken completely in spanish. I have zero language skills other than english but was pleasantly surprised when it came our turn and the girl took our order in 100% fluent enlish. Would go here again if I was ever in the area.,,,,,,

Later called me and told me the part \""was on back order!\""  Not so according to the salesman.\n\nWhy oh why would we want to do business with them in the future?  We were required to pay shipping ($13.00 for a plastic part that weighed no more than 1/2 ounce) plus tax, plus made several trips to the store and to be treated like that??

1,"I'm usually not a huge fan of airports because they are usually always a cluster-F...but something about this one makes going here less stressful.  Getting here is kind of goofy, especially if you are returning a rental car, but once you are here it is pretty easy to get in, get through security, and get to your gate.  There's a nice Starbucks before going through security and some cool Arizona touristy-type shops.  Once through security, which is usually painless, there's some fast food restaurants and a nice Mexican restaurant/bar right by the Delta terminals to help make the ride a little more enjoyable.  Not a bad airport!",,,,,,

-1,"The body worlds exhibit was great if you can get thru it in 1-1/2 hrs. Forget any appointments after 3pm--you will be rushed and not worth your money. Don't purchase the $5 audio phone unless you have 5 hrs to spend there, the dialogue is informative but much too long to accomodate time limits. I am sure this is because the science center wants you to come back 2-3 more times to listen to it all--NOT GONNA HAPPEN! We are members and don't appreciate being pushed to come back 3 times to see the entire exhibit, leave the center open until everyone has finished if you are going to schedule late appts like this\n\nNot happy at all",,,,,,
1,"I love Chipotle. This location, though not as good as the one on Camelback, for whatever reason, is still great.\nThe food always tastes fresh and the ingredients are the above standard. The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic.\nChipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic. \nAlthough the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil.\nNo matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly.\nIt is refreshing to have a business that actually cares and at the same time serve an amazing product.",,,,,,
1,"When I was in town and wanted to treat a friend to a Mexican dinner (a cheap dinner as I'm not currently flush with cash), my mom suggested El Bravo.  She knows me well - I like clean tasty Mexican dives and this was perfect. Note that when I say dive, I still want to eat on a real plate and sit at a booth with a modicum of cushioning. \n\nWhen you walk into El Bravo, don't be fooled by the window you see and the line of people standing there. (I was - until a nice woman standing in line told me there's table service.) Those people like the place so much they're picking up tortillas and meals to go. \n\nThe food was tasty and cheap. A winning combination in my book! The chips were thin and crispy with just the right amount of salt.  The salsa was chunky and fresh-tasting.  They're definitely not opening up jars of Pace in the back.  We both ordered the chili relleno dinners.  My friend loved the rice.  I thought it was fine but he really liked it.  So you might really like it too.  The beans were creamy with the requisite melted cheese on top.  I like my chili rellenos a bit plumper with more egg coating but the benefit of the size of these rellenos is you could finish your whole meal and not feel like a total pig.  \n\nWhen you pay, you look directly into the kitchen and they run a clean, tight ship there.  \n\nAll in all, a great place to grab two dinners with chips/salsa and one soda for $25 and change.  ($21 something for dinner plus $4 tip)",,,,,,

I had already purchased my wedding gown but still needed Bridesmaid dresses and Tuxes for the guys.\n\nOur original sales girl was great and very helpful.

I took 4 with me the first time, 2 had to make their own appointments and then I took the last 3 in...so I tried to make it as easy as possible.

The day we went it was close to 100 and so we were happy that there are so many water fountains sprinkled around the gardens. We stayed for about two hours enjoying all the beautiful displays. The gardens are set up so that one can enjoy many different environments. There a also a lot of shady spots with seating to rest and enjoy the surroundings. We will definitely be back soon!,,,,,,

1,"I have only been here for Happy Hours - so this is only a review for HH offierings and experiences.\n\nTwo visits - the first was a party of five, the second a party of six.\n\nSince Embassy provides Happy Hour for guests of the hotel (in another location, I am guessing), there was almost no one in the lobby bar, which is also the bar for Omaha Steakshouse.\n\nDrinks:  I ordered a whiskey and coke ($5.00 well drinks), and the bartender asked if I'd prefer ginger ale.  While I adore a good whiskey and ginger, most bars don't have REAL ginger ale - so I rarely order it.  As a bartender, I know I only make suggestions to change a customers order if we are out of the requested item or if I feel it will make the drink that much better.  I didn't imagine they could be out of Coke - so I am guessing it was a suggestion for improvement and I agreed to it.  GOOD CALL!  Not only was real ginger ale used - the angel behind the bar muddled in some fresh ginger for me, too!  YUM!\nMy companions had assortments of house wines, margaritas and beer.  Everyone was happy.\nThe food offerings are all appetizer sized and perfect for sharing.  And, only $5.00 during Happy Hour!\nThe wings are wings - nothing disappointing, but nothing to write home about.\nThe Buffalo Chicken Sliders were tasty - but the bread was really the standout part of this dish, and I did appreciate the large chunks of bleu cheese in the dressing.\nThe Hamburger Sliders are wonderful!  You can tell they are fresh grinding the meat from the quality beef they use.  The onions are sauteed to perfection and the buns are fresh, warm and the perfect golden brown.  Three to a plate - we had to order a second round of these!\nPulled pork sliders were unremarkable, but okay.  (Like the wings.)  There was nothing wrong with them - and at $5 for three sliders, I have no right to expect an epiphany.\nI can't do our last dish justice.  It's homemade potato chip \""nachos\"" with a bleu cheese sauce.  Honestly, despite having shared two orders of these on my first visit and one the second, I don't remember what else is on them but WOW - this is comfort food at its best and I can't wait to go back for more!\n\nThe room is not a typical hotel lobby.  There is a huge koi pond running throughout the lobby, and tall tropical trees.  I felt as if I was in a far cooler and more tropical area  - it was easy to forget I was in mid town Phoenix.\n\nIt seems this happy hour is still unknown - very few other people there for either visit.  But - I happen to adore the lack of loud music and ability to get top notch service - so that's not a complaint from me!\n\nIf they stretch happy hour to 7 instead of 6, I will gladly add on that elusive 5th star!",,,,,,

-1,"This store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures. We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked, and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone. The salesclerk told us that was not allowed. We were dumbfounded. We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, \""I don't know-- they just don't allow it.\"" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)\n\nWe tried to press further, though-- what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures? The salesclerk said, \""Oh, people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works.\"" I'm sorry, but unless you're omniscient, this is not acceptable. \n\nThe most insulting thing, though, is the clerk telling us \""I don't know\"" about a policy that's so clearly the exception to the local norm. If you're going to have a ridiculous, anachronistic rule, at least have the guts to explain why to customers when they ask.",,,,,,
-1,"I don't think there's much to Zen 32 besides looking trendy.\n\nSomething seemed strange about the place when I walked in, and after reading other reviews it's been pointed out--the waitresses are wearing Chinese attire with Mandarin collars. I won't hold the lack of authenticity against them. Also, the music is soft and the seating kind of cramped, making for an awkward dining experience.\n\nI'll get the good thing out of the way--the reverse happy hour. The hot ginger sake was overpowering, but for $1 there's no way I can complain. Also, they had a few basic rolls for $3, and that's not too bad. \n\nEverything else sucks! The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab, so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi? My tootsie roll was garbage, I couldn't taste anything beside the krab inside. The caterpillar roll looked nice, but I could only taste krab and eel sauce. Even the rainbow roll looked promising, and THAT was drenched in sriracha. \n\nI also had some of this teriyaki chicken entree, and it was rough and a bit dry. The edamame had way too much salt, and I began noticing a pattern to this place. Take crap and season it as much as you can.\n\nI'd like to give this place a second chance for a cheap date or something, but I'm still a little angry at this place (and their sketchy waitress!), for being the first to make me tired of sushi.

However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.\n\nI am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /",,,,,,
-1,"1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!\n2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.\n3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!\n Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!",,,,,,
1,"I love this place. They have such great food, i leave satisfied every visit.\nThe foods delish, the staff is friendly, and the decor is awesome. \nCould eat there everyday  :)",,,,,,
-1,"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. That is exactly where I am at with the beloved Swizzle Inn. But only with a certain semi-tall blonde (brunette w/highlights) bartender who apparently refuses to acknowledge me hanging over the bar with empty drink in hand as she prepares drinks for everybody else that walks up after me. Not on one occasion...three. Now, since I'm one to give the benefit of the doubt I can afford to give her some leeway. Here it is: 1) She is inept at her job who folds at the first sign of decent business and is unable to differentiate who was waiting first. 2) She would rather I be a six foot blonde chic who has the hots for her. 3) She is a racist that would prefer to snub me albeit I have a history of tipping well. 4) Number one and three. 5) Number two and three. 6) All of the above. 7) She can't handle the pressure of working at a small neighbor bar solo. \n\nWhatever the answer is, it's ashame because I'm all for the neighborhood bar. \n\nMy last attempt was to purchase a $50 gift certificate for a friend who loves the place. I'm actually glad this chic saved me $50 by acting like a flustered nincompoop. \n\nAlright, I'm done. This place is too cool to totally abandon but I'm not giving this particular \""woman\""any more of my money.\n\nThanks for reading.",,,,,,
1,"We've been on the lookout for inexpensive and tasty Chinese food. We're done looking! This place isn't fancy, but our take-out was delish! The pork egg foo young was super, and the honey garlic chicken was perfect. Crispy chicken with the right amount of sauce. The people running the place were very friendly, and the food was ready very quickly. And they deliver... We'll probably do delivery next time.",,,,,,
1,"The company did a nice job installing my fence and it looks good.  I especially appreciated Andrew's attention to detail when it came to preparing the bid, measurements, and explaining to me the variations in materials and the entire process.  I also appreciate that he was conscious of my budget and worked with me on that.  The company would have gotten five stars, but the install was a day later than what they agreed to.",,,,,,
-1,"The RAMEN is excellent.  The owners are sweet and the ambiance is pleasant.\n\nI gave it a low rating for the customer service. My first visit I was seated in the back and had to wait for service a lot, for long periods of time.  I didn't mind due to the gracious hospitality\n\nMy second visit, was terrible. They saw me walk in and didn't offer me a menu or greet me. A second customer walked in after me and they helped that person first, instead of me.\n\nFinally someone asked if I had a question. I said no, I'm waiting for a menu. He turned to the hostess and said \""oh, why did you tell me she had a question?\"" and then he just walked away leaving me to wait longer. \n\nWhen I finally got a waiter, I already knew what I wanted, I didn't waste the waiters time. I waited a LONG for my food until I ran out of time to eat it. THE WAITER DIDN'T CHECK ON ME AGAIN UNTIL I STOOD UP TO LEAVE. He had the nerve to ask if I needed anything. I told him I ran out of time to eat and had to leave. He didn't apologize, he just put the check on the table and left again. \n\nI do not know if this is a place where you have to wait for them to come grab the check or if you are supposed to take it up to the hostess but he never came back so I took it up to the hostess. She just stood there, IN FRONT OF ME, drying wet cups.\n\nI was just there for a lunch break soup. Why did it take an hour?",,,,,,
-1,"My experience was on a random Saturday afternoon, and I think that might skew my opinion a bit.\n\nDuring my visit we were the only guests dining.  There was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees.  \n\nThe atmosphere is mellow.  And I can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings.\n\nThe prices were a bit high for what we ate.  I had a pita sandwich and it was just under $10.  The lunch prices are a bit steep.\n\nThe food was okay, but nothing I'd go back time and time again for.",,,,,,
-1,"Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.\n\nI'm not sure if Palazzo is always open \""sometimes\"" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. \n\nEvery time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. \n\nAlso? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.",,,,,,
-1,"The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat \""chicken\"" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.\n\nI was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.\n\nThe service was friendly enough, though. \n\nNot to be recommended unless you're desperate.",,,,,,
-1,I brought my boots here to get fixed. They did a good job however the lady was extremely rude when I came to pick them up. I won't be going here again.,,,,,,
1,"The food was fine on my only visit to Blue Fin, when my son and I stopped in on a hot, off peak summer afternoon following a library assignment., but what  we remember most was the elderly Japanese lady who refilled our drinks, took several moments to chat, and repeatedly referred to my son as \""Son\"". Or possibly \""San\"" - I'm not entirely sure. \n\nShe just had a gentle grace about her, from another culture, and another era, that made a lasting impression on my teenager. That was three or four months ago, and he still brings her up every so often. \n\n\""Hey Dad. Remember that lady at Blue Fin?\""\n\n\""What's that?\""\n\nOh, who am I kidding.  She made an impression on me too.",,,,,,
1,Above average for airport food.   The service was friendly and the food was fresh.   The eating area needed a good cleaning.    A free to cookie to finish off the meal......better then expected.,,,,,,
1,"Great trails... A lot of bikers...  I have been running on south mountain now for years.  I like the part of south mountain that is in Ahwatukee.  I usually park by warpaint and then run from warpaint all the way down desert classic.  The trail is clean and offers trails that are easier and more challenging.  It's very peaceful and you can get lost (in a good way).  The only downfall, it is very rocky, so when you're running, watch out for rocks or else you'll have an accident like I did last week!  Try out south mountain, you will enjoy all of the hiking and nature and it's close to everything in the valley.",,,,,,
-1,"Rocking chairs don't mean much to the road weary traveler who has already been on the road, either on a plane or stuck in an airport for well over 12 hours; especially when said traveler realizes she is stuck in Charlotte overnight, and not in Nashville, where she was headed and has a reservation at a nice comfy hotel and dinner reservations somewhere yummy.  Add to this the fact that the place is a damned ghost town late at night and if you're really super lucky you just might get to wander the length of three entire concourses looking for someone who can help you, rushing with your heavy ass computer bag, because maybe, just MAYBE there is another flight?!  But there isn't, and the empty empty airport mocks you for being so foolishly optimistic.  And then you can go and stay at the Ramada for $59.  Only if you're lucky though.\nBetter signage would be nice Charlotte-Douglas, and white rockers don't quite make up for it.  Especially since you're a US Airways hub and I needed to find some US Airways help, which my ticket printout helpfully mentions I can find in any concourse, which is an absolute lie.\nWhite rockers and wi-fi are nice, but not that nice.",,,,,,
1,".  Angel, daughter of the Lounge's owner Joy is a HOOT!!  I love her personality.  It's not a fancy place, little hole in the wall type place. They have been open for 8 years and have had a pretty steady following.  There is art on the walls (LOVE the Dizzie Gillespie painting... thinking of buying it) painted by a local artist.  Live music on Wednesdays/Fridays.  Wednesdays step classes (the Al B. look alike) and they have another separate dining-type area.  Wednesday nights they hold something called a conversation party.  Random 5 topics are chosen (we had a peek at last night's conversations) EX:  Are momma's boys a good or bad thing?   What makes a partner in a relationship think they need to start playing games?  What is most important to you in your professional career?\n\nApparently some of these discussions, as you can imagine - adding the alcohol ingredient - can get pretty heated.  It seemed to be a big group last night... 15-20 people.  \n\nSo after dinner, catfish, PORK CHOPS TO DIE FOR!! So tender, fried hot wings, mac 'n cheese, mashed potatoes, LOTS AND LOTS of hot sauce, we heard the band start warming up.   YES!!  GREAT music.  People walked in wearing their Sunday best and others walked in wearing jeans.  It's an everyone knows everyone's name type of place.  Older people and the younger started trickling in around 8PM.  \n\nDefinitely a fun experience.  Good times.",,,,,,
1,"This is a super classy Fry's! They have a Starbucks, nice floors and lighting, and a natural foods sections, which I love! Healthy and organic shopping is becoming a lot easier to do at Fry's. Great deals and savings on milk!",,,,,,
1,"One of my all time favorites and the closest thing to authentic Mexican food I've seen in a restaurant (and being 100% Mexican American with a mother who is a great cook, I am PICKY about Mexican food). Do yourself a favor and try their lengua tacos. Long story short, though, I've never had a bad meal here!",,,,,,
1,"I love this place! Good for all ages and relatively cheap, a win-win!!\nIf you park in the heritage parking lot they win discount your parking ticket to only $3 bucks and its usually $12! another win!\n\nWe went and checked out bodyworlds and the brain, and if you have never been here, YOU have to go and check it out. Even if you have gone and you know someone who might enjoy it, i think it is the type of place you can go again and see/learn things that you missed your first time through. \n\nWe ended up on level two playing in the kids area( don't be fooled they have pretty cool stuff in there). plus, its o.k to let your inner kid out sometimes. :)\n\nA definite must see, and i won't be surprised if i end up back here again.\nVery cool!",,,,,,
1,"I couldn't believe it... I finally got my first cracked windshield last month. A quiet, unassuming little \""tink\"" sound and that was enough to start a crack that spanned the width of my windshield. Obviously an event to truly make anyone's day. So I turned to Yelp looking for some recommendations and came across these guys. Good reviews! So I called them and a few other places for some quotes and they came in as the lowest and stated they used glass from the same manufacturer that my original windshield was from. On top of that they were friendly and quite helpful. Sold!\n\nThe day came and I have to say I definitely picked the right people. Installation was a breeze, the tech was awesome and didn't mind my hanging out and watching (hey... I've never seen how this stuff gets done) while talking about video games and anything else. SUPER friendly, SUPER qualified. I couldn't be happier.",,,,,,
-1,"I'm not about reviewing fast food places, but I found out this Arby's was the first in Pittsburgh. It even has the HUGE cowboy hat out front as a marker. \n\nIt has all the stuff you'd expect, Roast Beef sandwiches, and those amazing Jamocha Shakes Arby's is known for.",,,,,,
-1,"We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati, and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at Morton's in Pittsburgh. Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey.",,,,,,
-1,Food and decor are horrific. Only redeeming factor is its location; well that and the fact that it's closed 8 hours a day.....,,,,,,

-1,"Ugh. I realize now that any place with the words club, factory or n things in their name I'm gonna give 2 stars or less. Or the word rainforest. But that's a different story. I dared to try something exotic. Salt and pepper shrimp. Hey, I'm Scandanavian. Pepper is an exotic spice to my people. But, I'm sorry, pepper must have been 86d that day. It was more like Salt shrimp. Or Soggy ass salt shrimp. Not good. We had the obligatory chain restaurant appetizer combo. No Awesome Blossom here folks. But overall this beat the entrees. Chased down with a lychee nut cocktail I was ready to quit this club. Service was amiable, but we were stuck in a corner, blocked in by a large party, with, ugh, children. Or as I so affectionately called them, Children of the Corn. Not much joy in this club. Or luck with entree selection. So I say no. No to the Joyless Luckless Bamboo Club.",,,,,,
1,"Mothers Day Brunch was awesome from the lamb comps, prime rib, crab legs, Belgium waffles, bacon, omelette, shrimp, sausage and orange juice. Great service and totally stuffed to the point where we could barely move afterwards.",,,,,,
-1,"Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!\n\nIf I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple.",,,,,,
1,"19 times out of 20 when we get Red Devil it's pizza and it's take out.  The pizza a really good and perfect take out.  If I had to be critical I'd say it can be a tad greasy, but its good pizza.\n\nIn the dining room the Italian food is really good.  The Chicken parm is perfect and all the dishes are quality with generous portions.  \n\nIf you want classic Italian you can't go wrong at Red Devil (and that goes for all the locations)",,,,,,
1,"Attended a buzzcation event tonight at Morton's. The venue was great and the right size for the amount of attendees, the food was GREAT and the service was the best I have seen at an event of this size. They served endives with blue cheese, salmon pinwheels, filet sandwiches and a tomato brioche that was superb. I hope they re book here for another event - either way I am sure to go back.",,,,,,

1,"This is a pretty cool little store. They have both salt and freshwater fish, which is nice because right now I only keep freshwater. I was a little disappointed in the selection of fish as I prefer fish that don't look like fish (knife fish, eels, hatchet fish, etc), but they had an amazing variety of plants that all looked very healthy and were fairly priced. The employee that helped me was extremely helpful in both the selection of the plants and the care. He also gave me a few tips for my fish even though I didn't buy any fish there. It's a nice shop and I'll probably will be going back.",,,,,,
1,"I don't go to a heck of a lot of movies in theatres (I'd rather curl up with my beloved NetFlix with a beautiful glass of wineand watch on my 5' x 7' theatre projection screen,  than walk on popcorn and lean my head back on a chair on wonder how many other heads of hair were here last).\n\nBut I have to say, there the experience at Cini Capri makes the theatre going experience something I don't mind going to in this cinema.  \n\nNow, if only they had a full service bar - why don't movie theatres do that, btw ??  (that's why the minus 1 star...)",,,,,,
-1,It was good but parking sucks and the chicken looked pink and I asked if it was ok to eat and they said that's just the way the chicken looks. So we will see if I get sick. Also they had problems with their soda machine.,,,,,,
-1,"OK place and i will probably try them again, however, the down side is that their prices are somewhat high and some cases comparable to new stuff on sale at Menards or Home Depot.\nIf you intend to pay more for a good cause, then it is OK, however, if you are looking for a good price on used and reused items, that is tougher to find at the Madison restore.\nI miss the st vincent depaul dig and save, they used to have building materials for good prices and i used to donate to them but they stopped selling building materials.\n\nThe Madison restire also does not carry the same variety as other restore stores, they will actually refuse certain types of items ...\nagain, i will probably stop and visit occasionally, but my expectations of a good deal are much lower.",,,,,,
-1,"I love the downstairs especially during thd winter with the fireplace. ..BUT the service last Friday at lunch at 12:45pm was inexcusable!  No employees for 5 minutes! Then still ignored while handing us menus (no water, no hi, no welcome) just slapped menus down and talked with an employee. When I told her we needed to be done in an hour ... she just looked at me and said I dont think so. We walked out! STILL NO WATER AFTER 10 MINUTES and NO ASKING US ANYTHING!!",,,,,,
-1,"i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however, i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed.  let's start with the good things.  QS has a great atmosphere, it definitely helped the transition from austin.  very chill \""hippie\"" vibe.  however, the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch \""hippie-elitest\"".  the food was alright.  their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things.  i do love their thai dressing, very yummy on the salads.  will i continue to go back?  probably, wishful thinking is  a good thing.",,,,,,
-1,"I ordered take out from here last night, and I love the idea of having New York filtered water in your crust. This is supposed to be the ingredient that makes real NY style pizza taste the way it does. I ended up ordering a sicilian style pizza, and got the full size pie. \n\nMy only complain in general would be the cost for my pie. Total after tax was 29 bucks, and thats a lot of money for just one pie. I understand the cost of food and labor along with the better quality ingredients, but I don't even spend that much on an Oreganos deep dish pie, and theirs actually taste better! The sicilian here doesn't really stand out. There's not enough sauce or cheese, and the toppings are just so so. The crust was nothing special, and I honestly thought that Pizza Hut's pan pizza tasted better. I got the Vinny, which has five toppings on it, and split my pizza with two on one side and three on the other. I got meatballs and tomatoes, and pepperoni, mushrooms, and black olives. Meatballs were dry as shit and sliced. Even Barro's has better meatballs! Everything else was just so so, I can get the same thing but better at Barros, at a fraction of the cost! \n\nAll in all, two stars for high cost and nothing to back it up. I get it, a bunch of people hype up your joint and that's fine, but follow through with it and make that 30 dollar pie blow my taste buds out of the water!",,,,,,
-1,A place Gordon Ramsay should visit.,,,,,,
-1,"I pretty much knew that visiting this place was going to leave a lot to be desired.  The food here isnt/hasnt been/never will be good. You would think for a place that advertises wings that they would be better but nope, they suck. Knowing this, this time I ordered the buffalo chicken sammich and my friend ordered some cheese sticks. Now the sandwich only comes with beans or coleslaw, to add French fries is extra. So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else. \n\ncustomer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any. The beer was good and cold...like it was posed to be. The place was LOUD too...which actually worked in my favor and helped to distract my kid. Other than that, I don't really have many good things to say about this place. Umm...it was clean. Yup. That's it.",,,,,,
-1,"I inherited a Muzak account from the previous business owner.  I couldn't believe that anyone would pay over $100 a month for this crappy service.  Every time the wind would blow we would lose the connection to the dish on the roof.  $300+ service fee for some guy to drive 4 hours to fix it.  Unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that.   I immediately canceled the service only to to told that there was some 60 month contract of  which I or the previous owner had never seen..........I'll let my lawyer handle that one.  \n\nIf you are using Muzak, I recommend you get out ASAP.   Sirius satellite service is only $25 a month and even better is their internet radio for $35 a month and both have much better selection, and you can make the changes on the fly.  \n\nAn even better option and the one I went with was Pandora DMX business service.  It is only $25 a month and you can tailor make the music to suit your needs, changing the stations is easy, and the system is programmable to allow you to set schedules, etc..  Much more feature reach than anything that crappy Muzak offers and less than 25% of the cost for me.",,,,,,
-1,"We stayed at the Shadyside Inn for months and spent thousands of dollars. I really wanted to write a good review, but the experience was disappointing. \n\nThe quality of service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude. When we provided feedback to the manager (Carol S.), she was extremely disrespectful. She was not receptive to customer feedback at all, and her response was very unprofessional, to say the least. \n\nWe also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall).  And the elevator did not work at times.\n\nWe will not stay at this hotel again.",,,,,,
-1,"There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait, Ruby Tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. Anyways, the only reason I keep coming back is because my husband's family LOVES to use their back room for every occasion. Ugh. Can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? \n\nSo since we are forced to show up for family functions I've had cause to try much of the menu, and most of it is average or below. The only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. If you're not getting that, don't bother. I've heard about free cookie Wednesday, but come on, is that really going to drum up that much business? At Eat N' Park, free cookies are a staple. Get it together Max & Erma...",,,,,,
-1,"Not a pleasant experience.  While looking at the menu, we ordered a margarita and a draft beer.  The beer came in a bottle instead of a draft and the margarita had a terrible funky taste - almost a \""plastic chemical\"" taste.  Next we chose to have chips and dips/salsa.  We were able to choose three dips/salsas and the server brought one that was incorrect.  To his credit, he promptly corrected the error and brought the right one.\n\nNeedless to say we elected not to have dinner and departed after drinks and chips.  There is much better Mexican food and drink in the 'burgh.",,,,,,
-1,"Stayed here  on 4/7 prior to a business meeting.  It had many of the usual Marriott niceties but no Starbucks or availability of coffee that was any better than Folgers or Yuban.  Maybe it's a Wisconsin thing but I thought that nearly every Marriott had reliable, dark roasted coffee.  The room was OK except that they put me in a second floor room that had windows which started at about 5 feet above the floor and the only view was of air conditioning/heating units and I am a lifetime Platinum.  I am not sure if the desk clerk felt it made little difference or what but this is not a crown jewel by any means.  I understand that this place was a Holiday Inn previously but usually hotels converted to the Marriott brand are better than this one was.",,,,,,
1,"I had a good basic hair cut here last week!  I was really impressed.  The stylist legitimately listened to what I wanted and was able to do a basic slide cut to texturize my super fine Asian hair. I'm not sure I'd come here if I wanted a dramatic change to my style, but for a trim and clean-up as I'm growing out, this is more than sufficient, and you can't beat the $13.99 price tag.",,,,,,
1,"Still loving the food!  The crispy shrimp taco's are my fav.  The shrimp are huge, the 2 tacos fill you up.  I tried the Parm cheesr fries, awesome!  This place has great food, only wish they had a full bar, a margarita would set me over the top!!!",,,,,,
-1,"Time for another riveting review for all my fellow Arizonians!\n\nLet's start by saying I have had dental issues for many years and in that time have seen MANY dentists!\n\nWhen the time finally came to have some serious dental work done  I chose Artistic Dental as I have seen his work on 2 people and was impressed with their results.\n\nBoth of these people had many teeth extracted and partials and or full plates done.\n\nI do realize it is a lab that makes them not the office\n\nI am very nervous going to dentists simply because I know the pain they are capable of inflicting, \n\nWhen I met Dr Daugherty I found him to be friendly and comforting.  The staff was wonderful and did everything they could to relieve my anxiety!\n\nWe came up with a game plan and part of that was to remove some teeth.\n\nLet's talk prices for a moment.. \n\nKeep in mind the office is in the Biltmore area...need I say more?  \n\nLocation and cost does not guarantee better work.\n\nThey are more expensive than any dentist I have seen but....they say you get what you pay for and my smile is very important to me.\n\nI decided to let him do my top teeth and if the results were positive I would let him do the bottoms.\n\nIt was several weeks before I was to start the work and I had a terrible toothache so I went in and  told Dr Dougherty which tooth was hurting and requested he pull it and that would make one less to be pulled in a few weeks.\n\nWhen he was done I looked in the mirror and was horrified to find he pulled the WRONG tooth!\n\nBecause of this I was embarrassed to smile in fear my big gap would be seen since the tooth was toward the front.\n\nAlthough the Doctor apologized I had lost my faith in him and was now petrified to have the remaining work done...\n\nWhen the time came I put on my \""big girl pants\"" and went back for the other extractions .  I made it clear how nervous I was and Dr Dougherty assured me he would be gentle and I wouldn't feel any real pain......HE WAS WRONG !\n\nSo  what would have happened if he told me the truth?  I now felt lied to ... So let's add things up to this point:\n\nHe pulled the wrong tooth\n\nHe lied to me\n\nHis prices are exsorborant \n\nMoving on... When I paid for the top work I had given them the full amount to cover top and bottom from the estimates they gave me... Although the estimates seemed to keep changing! \n\nThe top teeth, although beautiful simply did not fit right... Even after the alignment ... and the only way to fix it would be to drive the 28 miles each way to his office and leave iit with him and make the same drive back to get them with no guarantees .\n\nI decided to just deal with them and find a new dentist.  \n\nAfter my experience I put the dentist off for over a year and found a wonderful new dentist close to my house\n\nWhen I told this new dentist of my anxiety he was HONEST with me and said there may be some pain for a very short time during injections but they would do their best to distract me.\n\nWhat do ya know... Honesty... And it didn't kill either of us in fact I trusted him completely after that \n\nAt Artistic dental AFTER insurance I would be responsible for appox $1800.00!!!!!!\n\nMy new dentist did the same work for $725.00 after insurance!!  Saving me $1075.00!!!\n\nI called Artisic dental and told them I would like the $800.00 approximate  money they were holding sent back to me so I could get the work done.\n\nI also requested a refund of the \""alignment\"" since it didn't correct the problem. I was told they would speak with Dr and call back\n\nI got a call back and surprise surprise it seems they had a bookkeeping error almost 2 years ago and never billed something therefore they only owe me appox $300.00\n\nEXCUSE ME....WHAT? !\n\nI asked her why they are just finding this error now and why they have had my money for almost 2 years and never bothered to call and ask if I wanted it or if I was ever going to come in again.\n\nI told her that was unacceptable and their error from long ago just won't cut it nor should I be held responsible \n\nI had mentioned to her it would cost me $ 725.00. to have work done and I agreed to accept that and put this experience in the past .. Until.... Yesterday.\n\nI was with my friend who had her work done at Artistic Dental and she also told me of her \"" BILLING ERRORS\"" she had with their office and that is why she has not been back.\n\nIf you are looking to whiten your teeth or do cosmetic work I am sure Artistic will work for you.... But I would think twice about letting them do any serious work. \n\nMy last words of advise are.... Check their billing!!! Make sure they are billing your insurance only once and that you are getting the credits!\n\n\nOn that note I will say...\n\nLive each day as though it were your last and.... ENJOY!",,,,,,
1,"There is really one reason that I go to China Chili all the time...The boiled wontons.  The rest of the food is pretty typical chinese fare.  Best to take a group of friends and mix and match dishes. \n\nOur favorite dishes here, besides the boiled won tons, are the spicy eggplant and the green beans and tofu.  We order them extra spicy to kick it up a notch. Even extra spicy and Dan will load up both the boiled won tons and the dishes with the hot sauce at the table.  In fact we usually leave the hot sauce jar empty by the time we leave the restaurant.  \n\nParking is a bit hard to find on busy nights there and I usually end up parking on the street.  \n\nThe portions are gigantic and I always have take away dishes for the next day.\n\nPrices are reasonable.  If you do order the soup realize you can order it and share for the table.",,,,,,

I was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before. I also ordered different kind of foods but nothing can compare to the one usually I had before. If you really want to try a \""real mandarin wok\"" you should go to Mahomet where the original owner open a new restaurant name \""the wok\""",,,,,,

1,Had lunch here yesterday and have to say that they have great carne asada burritos.  Fresh Food and a huge portion.  Definitely the best burrito I have had in Phx.  The only downside is the neighborhood--probably not the best place to be at night.  Reminds me of Taquerias in the mission district of San Francisco--yummy,,,,,,
1,"God this place is good.  Stepping into their dinning room is like being with friends.  It's quaint and comfortable and the servers are always friendly.  As for the food, it is equally as enjoyable.  The mac n cheese is to die for and the fish n chips is the best I've had in the valley.  Their homemade tartar sauce is what really sets them apart. \n\nIt's a little tucked away, but quite the gem.",,,,,,

-1,"We ordered two pizzas and wings on a Friday night over the phone for pick up. They told us it would be ready in an hour. Sure, it's Friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable. My husband showed up an hour later and it was not ready. He had to park illegally because there is absolutely no parking available here and was very worried about the car getting hit. \n\nIt took another 45 minutes before he actually got the pizza. 1 hour and 45 mins is ridiculously long to wait! They should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed!\n\nWhen we tasted the pizza, it was... Okay. The sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland. Kinda like the pizza you'd expect from a street vendor at 3am in the South Side. \n\nWe will never be back and will remain loyal to Krazy Brothers and Molly's Pizza in dormont for now on.",,,,,,
-1,This probably the worst grocery store I've ever been to. It's constantly packed with usually only 2 cashiers helping patrons and as soon as you walk in it honestly smells like crap. I gave it 2 stars because at least the deli people have always been friendly and there isn't much for grocery stores in the downtown area. If you can avoid shopping here  do it you won't regret it,,,,,,
-1,Just a shame. The food is good but service is horrible. I've had nothing but bad servers with no concern for my experience. If you plan to sit at the bar downstairs you better block out 3 hours for lunch. They haven't figured out a way for the kitchen to fire out food for that part of the restaurant. There are too many good restaurants in this area to tolerate the Rokerij.,,,,,,
-1,"I went to the newly renamed 9/05 with a group under the recommendation that they did their tofu dishes really well and catered towards vegetarian foods.\n\nI guess the tofu itself was decent; thick, firm and textured, but the curry (which had been vaunted as one of the best dishes) fell completely flat. Where was the spice? Where was the flavor?? Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? To add insult to injury, everyone else at the table who had ordered the Pad Thai and Bangkok Dynamite dishes sniffling and complaining about the spiciness of their food. \""I'm Mexican\"" whispered one lady \""I LOVE spice, but this is too much with the chili flakes\"". At the end of the meal there was plenty of leftover food which everyone declined to take home. \n\nThe entr\u00e9es started at 10$ and so did the drinks, I was priced out of ordering one of their 15$ \""martinis\"" and stuck with a four dollar beer. The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.\n\nSomeone mentioned that ownership changed hands with the name changing, maybe the good cooks left as well?",,,,,,

1,"Gotta give it 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, from the ambience to the server to the food quality. \n\nTo start, like a reviewer said before me, the valet parking does seem to be for the actual Vincent restaurant, rather than for the Bistro.  And yes, there is parking in the back.\n\n**Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.\n\nWhat we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.\n\nWhat the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)\n\nEverything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not \""bad\"" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.\n\nEven better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!\n\nI will go back again and again.  (And to all you thriving young bucks, this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique, yet unpretentious, with amazing food and a manageable cost.  Score!)",,,,,,

Right when you walk in you can see on the counter what the lunch specials are, and I knew before I was seated what I wanted! \nI ordered the Sakana lunch special which was delish! It had rolls, jalapeno stuff crab popper things, tuna, salmon and other fish, came with soup & salad and was 10 bucks!! TEN BUCKS YALL!!! OMG it was delish! I know normally I would not be able to get all that for ten bucks!  \nSushi was fresh and great tasting, service was kinda slow, but it was a very busy Friday lunch rush! I am glad to have found them and to add them to my many lunch spots stops! \nI will be back!",,,,,,
1,Tried Welcome Diner for the first time tonight.  We did only try the Hurricanes but will definitely be back to try the biscuits. The place is very unique.  We sat outside and it was kind of like sitting in someone's backyard.  They have a walk up window if you chose to sit outside or you can sit inside at the small counter. It was happy hour all day since it was Tuesday.  Awesome!! Service as polite and quick. The Hurricanes were refreshing but not strong. Don't let the neighborhood or decor scared tour away. Can't wait to come back and try the food and other cocktails.,,,,,,
-1,"Looking at all the other reviews about this place, I wondered if we actually went to the same place.  I thought it wasn't very good.  I had the Eggplant Alexander which consisted of a bunch of soggy fried eggplant with a ton of cheese melted on it.  I've made much better at home.  My beloved had veal Parmesan.   Which was dry, overcooked and lukewarm.  Did we catch them on a bad day?  I'll never know because I don't think we'll return.",,,,,,

-1,"Wow. One of the worst meals I've had in awhile.\n\nMy husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.\n\nSoon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  \n\nWe both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left. I hate KFC and I would much sooner eat that than eat here again..",,,,,,
-1,"Went yesterday after my daughter's college graduation.  When the grad ceremony ran longer than expected, I called the hostess to let her know we had been delayed but were departing and hoped to be there soon.  As we were sitting in traffic, I received a call from a man who identified himself as the general manager and rudely asked if I still intended to be dining there.  After I explained our delay and that I had just spoke with the hostess, he (again very rudely) wanted to know how much longer I thought it would take for me to get to the restaurant.  \n\nWe arrived at Lydia's about 30 minutes late for a mid-afternoon reservation.   There were several large parties but quite a number of open tables.  Upon presenting at the hostess table, neither the hostess or the general manager acknowledged us for several minutes while they continued some discussion between the two of them.  We were seated at a small round table tucked in a corner - very small for a party of five.\n\nOur server arrived and explained the menu, which was the buffet brunch at the time. He spoke so quickly and mumbled so much that we had trouble understanding him.  We ordered our drinks and he indicated he would take our order when he returned with the drinks.  He later returned without our drinks and told us that they needed to break down the buffet to prep for upcoming dinner service so we could not have the antipasto or dessert portions of the brunch. Instead they would charge us ala carte but we would be limited to the entrees on the brunch menu and they could provide a Caesar salad or cup of soup.  He the left and returned later to take our order - still no drinks. \n\nWe eventually received Caesar salad (not fresh, limp and overdressed) and drinks.  We were seated within view of the antipasto buffet and were able to observe that we were on to the service of our entrees well before the antipasto buffet was broken down. Clearly there was no reason that our menu needed to be so restricted.  \n\nFood was ok.  Chicken was salty and overpowered by capers.  Individuals who ordered pasta trio indicated two of three were good.  Unfortunately, the table set up required the server to hold the pasta skillet over my lap in order to serve those seated on the other side of the table.  No mishaps but a few close calls.  Amounts provided in first serving were small and it was nearly impossible to get an additional serving.  Two individuals never did receive the second serving of one of the pastas that they requested.  We were able to order from dessert menu.  Desserts were unremarkable and very small.  \n\nService was horrible.  Our server did not return.  Took great effort to flag him down for additional drinks.  House wine and mimosa were overpriced at $12 and $13 respectively given size and quality.\n\nGentleman bussing our table was the only positive of our experience. He was friendly and accommodating.\n\nI will not return again and would discourage others as well.",,,,,,
-1,"Went to check out a game with some friends and was horrified at our service.\n\nOne of our party received a cold pizza roll and brought it to our server's attention. \n\nHow tacky can one be in deciding to stick one's finger in a patron's food and declare the patron wrong?\n\nUnbelievable. \n\nAnd then the manager decided to get in on the action. He made a special trip to our table to declare the server was correct in her statement and her action because she was requested to stick her finger in the food in question.\n\nReally?\n\nIf this is any indication of how customers are treated at Picasso's, rest assured that members of my party took note and WILL spread the word.\n\nMy first and last visit. \n\nThank you for a great football Sunday.",,,,,,
1,"I wish we had a happy hour sushi bar that started at 10pm for the night lovers in all of us in Charlotte, NC! Zen 32 offers $3-$6 happy hour sushi rolls, appetizers, and some drinks from 10pm-2am. \n\nThe quality of the sushi was very good! I wish at the time I would have been more hungry, I could have eaten it up! The spicy tuna and vegetable rolls were great...I can't remember the other rolls we ordered, but just as delicious.\n\nThe downfall was the service. Initially we were greeted by the hostess, but it took approximately 18 minutes for a server to show up. Typically that would have been unacceptable and I would have said something or just left, but it was on New Year's Eve and was a reunion with friends that I had not seen in a long time so we were just chatting. However, I think the hostess caught on to how long it had been because when we eventually started looking around we caught her eye and within another minute, our server showed. \n\nThe atmosphere is dim and intimate. They also have a patio (with heat lamps). Overall, I enjoyed my experience and the food was delicious! Next time I'm in town, I'll visit you again Zen 32!",,,,,,

-1,"On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.",,,,,,

1,"Ditto to all the positive reviews out there.  This place rocks.  The outside actually isn't THAT bad, but yes, I would hesitate to go in if it weren't for all the fantastic reviews on yelp.  Once inside, it is just as all the pretty yelp pictures depict: a clean and bright dining room with colorful tables and chairs.  My friend and I ordered the mixed seafood cocktail and the shrimp culichi.  Both were super tasty, as were the complimentary ceviche tostadas.  The culichi sauce was so good that I had to stop myself from drinking it.  The seafood cocktail was very refreshing - just what is needed during the Phoenix summer.  It had shrimp, oysters, clams, abalone, calamari, and octopus.  Almost all the seafood was fresh and sweet, and the dish was huge.  The only critique is I can do without the clams.  They are the tiny canned ones instead of the fresh ones like I had in the cocktails in Mexico.  Service was really good as well.  Overall, this was a very pleasant experience.  I will be back and I am telling everyone I know about this new find.",,,,,,

-1,"This was my first time visiting Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. I thought that the concept of a noodle bar was interesting. \n\nI was kind of unimpressed by the lunch menu. There weren't that many options and I had a hard time finding anything that jumped out at me. Many of the lunch options were for rice or salad. I really wanted noodles, ie a noodle bar. \n\nI went for a Udon Combo Special with a California Roll. The roll was whatever, but the chicken in my soup was basic and kind of bland. \n\nThe food was average, but it was the service that left me unimpressed. The waiter was short and was very impersonal. He made my table feel rushed and as if we were an inconvenience for patronizing the restaurant. When we were ready to pay our bill, we asked for a spit check and he proceeded to tell us that he \""couldn't do tax in his head\"" so basically too bad. We decided to spit the check 4 ways to be as easy as possible. Then as we were leaving he reprimanded us for not asking for a spit check before hand. I think it would have been nice for a server to be observant and ask us if we needed that rather than expect the table to make that known. A little foresight and customer service would have made a huge difference.",,,,,,

I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was definitely not busy but there were a few tables and the bar area seemed pretty full. The two beers that I had were decent but not amazing. (a hefeweisen and an IPA) Four Peaks Brew House is much better in my opinion. \n\nThe service was awful. Nothing good or personable about it. Considering it was not very busy I expected more out of someone, anyone for that matter! (maybe they were angry because they had to work on Halloween) My drinks took longer than normal to receive and my Kobe burger took quite awhile too. I wasn't keeping track of the time but how hard can it be to throw a burger on the grill and fry some fries? I was expecting more from this \""top seller\"". Not impressed and I will not be returning, if the beer and food were amazing I might come back even if the service sucked but if all three of these important factors are not up to par I will spend my money else where. Next time I'll take the extra 10 minutes to get to Four Peaks.\n\nAlso I noticed the menu was really, really random. They don't specialize in any particular type of food. Fish and chips, and then some southwestern dishes....? Whatever, I appreciate small, local restaurants but this place is all wrong.

-1,"So help me God, if I ever get married or have a sex change and need a tuxedo, I am never coming to this Men's Warehouse again.\n\nWe unluckily got helped by Morgan to get fitted for a wedding my boyfriend is in this upcoming July. From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount.\n\nSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers.\n\nWow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying \""Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\"" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check!). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense.\n\nSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help.\n\nAnd what's a cake without icing? Totally watched a dude smoke in front of the store and then come in and measure my boyfriend for the tux without washing his hands. Hands, cigarette, mouth, touching customers. YUCK!",,,,,,

Typically I would give it a 3-star but some of the service wasn't the greatest and my food was cold...\n\nC's is the kind of family-friendly experience that makes it a 3 to 4 star restaurant on a good day, but on this particular day, our primary server was impatient and lacked a customer-first attitude and the quality of food was lacking. However, the service for a never less then half empty coffee mug, was superb. \n\nI do love the bakery items so couldn't resist the pecan roll, but my egg sandwich with hash browns could have been better. The hash browns were cold and the croissant was dry. The bacon however, crispy, just like I requested.\n\nBut, I was with my family, we were tucked in a cozy corner booth, had great conversation and due to the history of this restaurant and the many times I've been there before, it would be a place I would recommend. I guess the day I was there was just an \""off day\"". That happens.",,,,,,
-1,"My boyfriend and I booked a room on the executive floor for new years. We got here right at check out time and we were told it would be another 20 minutes before the room was ready....an hour later, here we are in our room with a bath tub that the paint is chipping off of and the tv doesn't work. We were charged for a movie that we can't even watch. Highly dissapointed. You would think that with a big name like Hilton, the room and service would be superior. Very lackluster.",,,,,,
1,"ulta is basically the lower-end of sephora. it's great because you have all the drug-store brands of make up you can find there, NYX is the best of them all by far, and you have a couple higher end brand there, and a variety of perfume and cologne.  They also sell CHI straighteners!!!  and have a salon.  i get my hair cut there and i like it, i have experienced a couple of places and ehhh. but i like ultas, but it does depend on your stylist.  the price is maybe slightly cheaper than tony a guy. but i'm satisfied with ulta!\n\nthey constantly have many sales, like buy one get one etc, on hairspray, shampoo, face wash so its great since i go into get some, and check out other things as well. again, if they had MAC i'd be there alot! lol. but overall it's good,",,,,,,
1,"Big Wa is excellent! This is one of my and my husband's favorite restaurants in the area. We were thrilled to find a restaurant that serves great Chinese food in a relaxed atmosphere. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the portions are huge (we always have leftovers).\n\nI like to try different dishes on the menu, while my husband sticks to his favorites (he loves the Obama noodles with shrimp). The house fried rice and General Tso's chicken are really good. We love the food, the people, and the reasonable prices. We'll definitely be back for more! :-)",,,,,,
1,"Few things make me happier than wine and cheese -- so naturally, I enjoyed the Cheuvront! I wasn't in the mood to make any decisions myself (it was Friday, after all) so I let one of the owners surprise me with his favorite red wine and a cheese plate. The shiraz he picked was delish, and the cheese plate, especially the brie, was equally yummy. I'd suggest you go for happy hour, sit on one of the comfy couches, ask your server or an owner for their recommendations, and try a bunch of stuff!",,,,,,

1,"I love visiting D & D. This place is about the atmosphere as well as the food. On the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate America, moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories, a few networkers collaborating on a project and one or two snooty folks. It make up a wonderful array of folks having lunch. \n\nOn the weekends there are families, dogs, children, babies, old folks, young folks sharing stories and sitting outside listening to the great performer chosen for that weekend. There are misters around the patio area.\n\nI love the nooks and crannies where you can sit inside or outside. The sandwiches are good. I love the turkey on dark rye with avocado. They are generous on all fronts. Yes the place is pricey! Drinks, sandwiches and chips can run almost $30 for two people! However you get a free small concert on the weekends. The kids run loose, the dogs bark and it is fun! The wait staff is incredibly friendly and several folks have been working there for years. \n\nThis is not a place for those individuals looking for a fancy dancy sandwich. This is a place to have fun, relax and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere!",,,,,,

1,"For my first time it was pretty decent. Just as everyone said it is pretty pricey. I had the taco plate which consists of two tacos, seasoned rice & refried beans. My bill was 11.57 for that. Pretty steep considering that usually runs $7 most places. But I can say 3 hours later I am still full as if I just left the table. The chips, salsa, & refried beans appetizer was a great start to meal as well. My friends have already planned the next visit in which I will try the swirled strawberry/mango margarita which is 24 oz for 6.99. Sounds like a steal. I hope the flavor is above the price.",,,,,,
-1,"Nothing was torn or stained, but a lot of the clothes looked worn and a little faded.  And yeah, I get that Plato's Closet sells clothes that HAVE been worn, but they're not supposed to LOOK it.  I'm kind of surprised by the previous reviewer who stated that the clothes are geared toward the 25-34 age bracket.  Um, were we in the same Plato's Closet??  Most of the stuff looked pretty cheap and teenybopperish to me.  I can see going here if you're looking for something disposable for going out on campus, but definitely not to build a professional wardrobe.",,,,,,

1,"Fig and marscapone bruschetta is to die for. I crave it all the time! Vintage 95 in Chandler has attempted to copy Postino's recipe for success, but it doesn't compare to the service, atmosphere and quality that Postino is known for. Prices are completely fair, wine and beer selection is great. The Mixed Green salad was totally amazing. I drive 30 minutes from Gilbert to get there, and it is worth every minute. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open! One of the best places in Phoenix, hands down.",,,,,,
1,"Authentic Home Style Cooking from El Salvador with a great tasting selection of delicious items to choose from their fantastic menu. Seafood, Meats, Appetizers, Salads, Pupusas and Traditional Entrees as well as Tasty Desserts. They even provide pictures that you can see of each of the dishes on the menu. Nice!\n\nInside is clean and tidy with fun items on the walls that give you the sensation of being in a little tucked away place in El Salvador. The service was very friendly and helpful when I arrived and when it was time to order. I saw some photos on Brother Yelp and showed a few to her and said I want this one and one of your famous Pupusas to test out.\n\nOrdered the Churrasco Salvadore\u00f1o plate which is Steak, Shrimp, Sausage, Black Beans and Rice, Queso Fresco, Fried Plantain, handmade Tortillas and then some. Had to get a Pupusa and asked her what she recommend. She happily replied Pork, Beans and a Cheese or Revueltas con Chicharr\u00f3n,Queso y Frijoles as shown on the menu. It comes with a delicious side of spicy cabbage and a very tasty red sauce that you put on top for some extra kick. Hotter sauce also available on the table if you are crazy like me.\n\nEverything was packed with flavors and super good. This is not your typical Mexican style food. You must check it out to experience it. In the same complex as Family Dollar store in the deep corner. Yummo!\n\n4.5 STARS",,,,,,

They are so friendly and get to know your name, and bend over backwards to make sure you start your day off right.

I'd been to a hometown buffet before so when my bf suggested it I relied on my memory of the experience and agreed to go.  Unfortunately my memory must have been jilted by the occasion or this Hometown Buffet was just bad, I dont know.  what I do know is that the food is cheap, about 10$ per person.  It is also soft.  And by this i mean everything is overcooked.  And it all gave me heartburn that lasted all day.  So will I be back?  Maybe in about 10 years when I've forgotten about this experience.",,,,,,

-1,"3 1/2 star rating?! How much crack are you people smoking!? I will give you three (3) reasons this place sucks balls:\n\n-The whole point of an outlet is it to supply energy...none of your outlets do this..so what are they? Because, they certainly are not outlets. Three separate attempts in different walls (including a charge station proved fruitless. Sonofabitch!).\n\n-Your courtesy people transporters make the most annoying, continuous whirling beep. Jesus Christ why?! Its obnoxious, but it fits your airport well I guess.\n\n-Your employees are lifeless. I go in to get a protein bar, and the woman made 0% eye contact with me the entire time. When she said \""have a great day\"", she must have been talking to the magazine rack.\n\nYou get two stars, go sit in think time and figure out how to call and hire an electrician who can re-wire your outlets. ALL YOUR OUTLETS...LOL.\n\nGo sit in a corner somewhere and figure out how to properly run simple, basic crap. Like the people transporters...Get them to stop whirling like the Pope and Gandhi commandeered these vehicles, began grinding, and then left the alarm on demanding everyone watch them grind....\n\nAnd finally, sit in a corner and figure out how to stop hiring vegetables. Look for people who can have the potential to smirk at me. Just a smirk. I am asking....for just a smirk. I am not that ugly...I think.\n\nCharlotte....silly Charlotte.",,,,,,

She said that no one was available to do a consultation in the near future. Not sure how this is possible unless the service is drastically understaffed.  A normal person would proceed to ask if I would like to have a consultation at a later date.  Instead, she literally said \""No one is available. Sorry.\"" and then hung up.  It was the most confusing and frustrating conversation I've ever had in my life.",,,,,,

I'm due to go there again for the next size up as he keeps growing!  \n\nI've also found some good deals on yarn for the hand knitted preemie hats I make to donate, tho sometimes their prices are almost as much as new yarn at Michaels.",,,,,,
-1,"My boyfriend and I visited for the first time ever on Thursday. I work for Darden, so I was expecting great service and delicious food. The food was nothing amazing, but it was still a decent value for the price. However, our waiter was extremely rude. He acted like it was a burden to serve us. I'm assuming it was our age, but that shouldn't matter. I'm a server myself and it's wrong to treat your guests like they are wasting your time. It made the entire experience quite disappointing.",,,,,,

-1,"I'm surprised how well this deli is reviewed... I've given it about 5 chances now.  It always looks promising, and is right next door to the Jewish bakery which I love.  Unfortunately, I've been pretty let down each time I've tried to grab some good food from Scott's.\n\nThe service is terrible, at least for take-out.  They take their time and acknowledge you if they feel like it.  I don't know about dine-in service, but you can tell having a smile would get a waitress fired.\n\nAs for the food... potato knishs looked outstanding, tasted like something you could buy frozen.  Bagels were okay but I had the bar raised.  Scallion cream cheese left a lot to be desired, which is sad because I consider a good everything bagel with scallion cream cheese to be the ultimate new york breakfast treat (after a good egg sandwich, of course).  Damn, the egg sandwich was awful that one time... did they get their bacon from Wendy's?\n\nStill looking for a good NY deli, so feel free to pass one on!  Wish it could have been Scott's.",,,,,,

1,"I have been coming to Silver Touch since I have been driving. It used to be a Weiss Guys, but was bought out by another member of the family. Everytime I have brought a vehicle here they have done a great job. They offer many services and options for your individual needs. The prices are reasonable and they offer a discount if you come back in a week. With the monsoon season upon us this could come in handy. I drive the 15 minutes to get my car washed here. It's what I know. Maybe I'm afraid of change?",,,,,,
-1,I would not recommend this place at all. I've driven by this place going to work. I picked up food for some co-workers and the chili rellenos had a piece of chewed gum in it. That is the most gross un-hygenic thing a restaurant could possibly do. We were so disgusted that we didn't call and complain. There is no excuse for this! I will never recommend anyone to go here.,,,,,,
-1,"Full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian. \n\nMy family loves steak and I love my family so that explains how I ended up here.  I have actually been this is steakhouse several times over the years and have enjoyed their grilled portobello mushroom - it was one of the best I had ever had and I was looking forward to eating it again.\n\nSometime within the past 18 months, they took their beautiful portobello off the menu.  Their new vegetarian \""entr\u00e9e\"" - pick any 3 side dishes.  Are you kidding me??!! That is NOT an entr\u00e9e!  As a vegetarian, I am used to eating only side dishes at certain places (like steak houses) but to have that listed as an THE vegetarian entr\u00e9e is slightly insulting.  This is a fancy pants restaurant and I would expect them to at least keep some pasta in their kitchen! \n\nThe waiter lacked genuine warmth.  When I asked him to talk me about their Malbecs (they had 3 or 4), he only described 1 - their \""feature\"" wine.  When I further inquired, he only talked more about their feature.",,,,,,
-1,"I can only review the nonpareils and truffle sampler.   The nonpareils are very low quality dark chocolate and for 14.00 per pound definitely not worth it.

-1,"I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the \""8th Ward\"" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as \""garlicky\"" on the menu. Sooo wrong. \""The Butter,\"" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.\n\nAt this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. \n\nI wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction.

-1,"After a long morning meeting at the beautiful August Wilson Center on Liberty Ave. My coworkers and I needed food ASAP! We decided to go right across the street to Mahoney's! It didn't look like it would be pricey or the food would be bad. \n\nAs you walk in you immediately see the bar area with TVs and Bar stools, as you walk in a little further the tables are set up in the back with plenty of room. A different set up that you don't see often, but I really liked it. \n\nThe food was typical bar food, but with a little more pizazz. The 1/2 sandwich soup and sandwich combo was actually smaller than I had hoped. The food itself was not too bad. Not my favorite. The French Onion soup was a bit salty and the mayo for the sandwich seemed warm. I tried the fries which were good but a bit too greasy for my taste. \n\nMy friend's Greek salad however was very tasty. It had a great mixture of greens, feta cheese and even potatoes! \n\nThe staff was nice and the prices were good. \n\nA place I would go back to but not regularly.

-1,"Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.",,,,,,

-1,"I ordered take out from this P.F. Chang's on Tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible. Not only I was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone, the food was soggy, underprepard and bland. For example, the Kung Pao Shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy. My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst. \n\nDelay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude.\n\n Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F. Changs I have been so far, I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off. This time I have received nothing (only a half hearted apology of the manager). \n\nin my opinion, if a customer waits 45min in the restaurant for a $110 pickup order made on the phone, prepays AND still gives $5 tip, I expect to get something off the bill. Here, however, I have received nothing.\n\nI will not visit this restaurant anymore and cannot recommend it. Sadly it has lost its game - maybe it was the Tusday manager.",,,,,,
1,I took a friend who was visiting from out of town to Saturday brunch and both of us were pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is great and the food even better.  I had the Benedict and Enchiladas (Richardsons Combo) and was a bit surprised (in a good way) by the burn of chili peppers.  The smoked pork loin on the Benedict was also noticeable and overall it's probably been one of the best meals I've had in quite a while.,,,,,,
1,"I walked into Best Buy trying to decide what digital camera to buy.  I have been a customer for many of years and have found out that I can always go into the camera section and walk out comfortable and confident in anything I purchase.  I have been in there several times for cameras, cam corders etc and I always try to find one employee named Tammy.  She has never pointed me in the wrong directions, always has a wealth of knowledge to give me and always has a positive attitude.  I went in there about a week ago looking for a new camera for two big vacations and tolf her what I am specifically looking for.  She answered all of my questions honestly and straight forward.  She also helped me save money buy buying other accessories that I will definitely use.   If I ever go in there I look for her or patiently wait for her to finisih up with a previous customer, so I can ask any and all questions knowing she will guide me in the best direction.  I went on one of my two trips and so far the camera is awesome.  I did buy an extra battery because I thought I would need it, but I went 6 days of nonstop photo taking and it still shows a full battery. The pictures turned out great and I am very happy with my purchase.  The true test is when I am in Ireland and trying to capture the beautiful scenery and all the memories that I will have.",,,,,,

1,They have the friendliest staff around. I hope they stay the same under the new ownership!!!!!\n\nGood luck guys...,,,,,,
1,4.5 stars.  I had their Bombero Burrito with green chile for the first time today...was SOOOO good.  I disagree with Shaun C.  I love the sauce they have in this burrito....,,,,,,
-1,"Asked sales associate if they match competitors prices and was told \""we don't have competitors\"". We told him if that's the case then we'll just go back over to your competitor and buy from them.",,,,,,
1,The garden is lovely and they do some fun events here. I have brought out of town guests here and I recently attended a wedding in the garden which was lovely. The luminarias in December are well worth a visit.\n\nThe cafe has some good food options and the prices are fair. Their plant sale is also very good and my mother goes every year. I can't wait for the temperatures to cool down a bit so we can go and enjoy the gardens some more!,,,,,,
1,"Someone recommend this place for my trip to Phoenix, so I thought I would give it a try. \n\ncarne asada burrito\nFish tacos\nSuper Nachos\n\nI'm kicking myself for not yelping this place first and checking out the famous items. Upon arriving the location I was totally overwhelmed by the menu, people and the bakery/market. I'm not use to seeing this back in Cali. I was somewhat in a trance and didn't realize what I was ordering until after I got my food. I wish I put more thought into it. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I wished I got something else. \nMy only complaint was that my carne asada burrito was more tortilla and beans then meat.",,,,,,
-1,"I should have kept driving when we pulled in and there's paramedics with a huge Fire Engine in front of the restaurant with gobs of odd looking people standing around the commotion.  I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to.  \n\nBut if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch....apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture but after being in the middle of two pretty intense verbal altercations that quickly turned violent, I knew this was going to be one of those experiences that I would write about on Yelp!  There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet.  I should have also noticed something was \""up\"" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot.  But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal.  There were a lot of people shouting at each other and arguing, lots of mentally ill people glaring at us almost in an antagonistic manner.  \n\nBesides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap!  I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient.",,,,,,
-1,"This is a must read! Ok, food was actually good, but one star for one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.  I read all the yelp reviews and wanted to give this place a chance, so I did and won't do it again. Please, please, please don't go here. I called in an order to pick up, the guy couldn't understand me and said 5-7 minutes. Drove over there, clarified my order (which he had wrong) and waited. Apparently they were short staffed so the \""waitress\"" was doing a delivery. After waiting 10-15 more minutes I gave him a credit card, he said he didn't know how to work the machine, so I patiently waited for the \""waitress\"" aka delivery lady to come back.   This is where it gets good, she charges me a wrong amount, less, but I didn't notice and just wanted to get out of there. So I generously tip them out of guilt and then get a call from them asking for my credit card because she didn't charge me for everything. I explained I wasn't driving back there, she asked for my CC over the phone and refused. I felt their service was horrible and it was their mistake. Had I not wasted 20+ minutes there (as my food got cold) I would have not been so stubborn. Bottom line- don't do it! Money is too precious to waste on places like this.",,,,,,
-1,"Avoid this location. My wife and I both ordered a meal that came with a cookie for desert. We got home and realized they didn't give us the Cooke. We returned since we were really feeling like desert and they said the were out and substituting a biscuit or side since they were out of cookies. We question how a biscuit is like a desert since we wanted something sweet and asked if instead of two cookies we could split a slice of pie. The manager quickly informed us that two cookies is $.99 and a pie is $1.99. I asked if she could just make the substitution since we had to drive all the way back and since it was their mistake to begin with and she refused. I just left because we didn't feel like more food, we wanted dessert. How is it that if you make a mistake and run out of desert and then just leave it out of the meal althogether you feel you don't have to substitute with something similar. What a waste of a trip. The one bright side was the person who helped us was very friendly. His name was William.  He should be promoted as I could tell he wanted to take care of us.",,,,,,
1,"Very knowledgeable wait staff to help suggest wine pairings with your meal, and the food is consistently amazing from bite to bite and dish to dish. A very romantic place to take your significant other, or just an excellent place to have a terrific meal with friends. Everyone should experience this place at least once, it's that good.",,,,,,
-1,"I've been to this Applebee's about five or six times over the last 3 years.\n\nThe menu is, of course, classic Applebee's, something for everyone.  But I found the service to be listless.  When I entered the restaurant the last time, the two hostesses were sitting down; they lifted their eyes to see me, and then reluctantly brought their bodies upright.  One of them greeted me without a smile, and slowly showed me to my seat.\n\nThe waiter who took my order only said about two words, and I was supposed to guess what my role was at that moment in the non-conversation.\n\nZombies have taken over this restaurant.  It's more \""Shaun of the Dead\"" than \""My Dinner with Andre.\""",,,,,,
1,"I got there at 8am, they had me in the back by 810am, and by 830 am I was done.  Had a diabetes exam so they had to dialate my eyes, which makes them very sensitive to light.  They gave me some dark lenses to put behind my glasses also.  The lady that dialated me was great too.  Friendly,  nice, and I would go back in a heartbeat.....thanks Southwestern Eye Center.",,,,,,
-1,"Waited over 40 minutes for a half-pound of dry ground beef; nothing \""BBQ\"" about the BBQ Western burger. If the rest of the menu is the same quality, no wonder they need girls in shorts and tank tops to get customers!",,,,,,
-1,"Let me preface this by saying this used to be my favorite restaurant in PHX... This experience has changed that...  I made a reservation for 11 5 days before the dinner at 730 pm on a Sat..  after arriving promptly at 730 we were forced to wait 20 minutesonly to be sat at 2 separate booths...  Completetly defeating the purpose of a group dining experience..  Now the bad part...  For dinner I ordered off the special menu a wild boar bacon wrapped bone in beef tenderloin cooked rare..  I received a baconless well done hunk of meat...  I pointed this out to the waitress she took the meal hoping to have it prepared correctly..  a few minutes later the manager approached the table and informed me they were out of the bacon ( one would think they would know that before the meal was prepared and attempted to slide this past the diner). I was offered a replacement meal , but declined and decided to go with the soup.... This prompted the manager to inform me it was a spicy dish to which I accepted and said it was fine, he proceeded to inform me of the heat of the dish 2 more times both times I assured him this was fine leading him to question my order again at which time I was in disbelief and asked if there is some reason he doesn't want me to  have the dish..   this was enough to finally agree to let me place the order the soup came and was excellent and spicy.   I managed to persevere through the heat and eat the whole bowl ( I enjoy spicy food).  This ruined the whole experience for me ..  luckily everyone else's meals were enjoyable its just disappointing being treated like that at a place I thought so highly of and do everythingin my power to get people I care about to do it....  A sad day",,,,,,
1,"Dropped off my cousin here for their flight to California. The parking is not a hassle and a lot of things has changed since I remembered back in high school. Everything was under construction, caution tape everywhere, and just looked unappealing. Taking the time to actually tour around the place it is pretty nice and impressive. You got a variety of stores, lounging areas, and of course the restaurants. Very nice because it is still improving and still building more restaurants there. \n\nThe baggage and check in stations are very easy to do and don't need much help. That is a big part for me because airports can be very busy so the less time checking in the better. So, overall, I'd have to say even though I haven't been to a lot of airports Sky Harbor by far has to be one of the best in categories ranging from being clean, exceptional service, and having a variety of stores/restaurants.",,,,,,
-1,"This is the most outdated and dingy major city airport I've ever seen. I was shocked that such a large beautiful and clean city has this to offer as it's first and last impression. CLT is begging for a major renovation!\n\nThe location, however, is stellar. A super short jaunt to the metro area. They also have a Cinnabon and that counts for a lot in my book.",,,,,,
1,"I hadn't been to this pub in several years but spotted it on my first Valley Metro Rail ride.  I went straight for the Fish & Chips with a salad substitute for the chips as I have been doing lately to be more \""health conscious\"".  The large \""fried \""cod was very good but the salad was ordinary head lettuce with a pink hydroponic tomato half and lone onion ring.  \n\nOtherwise, the pub experience with the assorted English, Scottish and Irish flags plus noisy crowd was reminiscent of pubs I had seen in London and Ireland.\n\nIf I hadn't been riding the rail several more years could have gone by before re-visiting so the rail should help some of the restaurants over time.",,,,,,
1,"Good food, good people, good prices.  Seemed like a popular neighborhood restaurant, lots of regulars greeted with a smile or by name.\n\nFood was a little salty for my taste, but it was still decent quality and large portions. Plenty of options and no trouble with customizing.\n\nThe staff were terrific.  They clearly knew what they were doing, and always went a step above - bringing dough for the kids the roll out, refilling your glass before it's empty, chatting up customers.\n\nThe decor features old family photos of the owner's Italian heritage.Great touch.",,,,,,
1,"I missed the Lobster and Steak Day. It moved from Monday MNF to Thursdays. Its Kinda a cool spot to watch MNF. Staff are nice. Food honestly is really good. The Dj Wouldn't play Digital Undergrounds \""Freaks Of the Industry,\"" said it was to slow for time. Free Parking.",,,,,,
1,"My wife and I went here after searching for cheap Mexican food on Yelp. The place looks like a dive on the outside, in a strip mall next to a 7-11. We ordered ceviche, grilled steak taco, shrimp taco (off menu), grilled steak burrito, and chips and guacamole, all for less than $14. The ceviche was excellent! The girl behind the counter said to ask for it on the side instead of on top of the tostada and you get more. The portion was generous for the price ($3.50), and very tasty. The tacos are very small but also tasty. The burrito we took home for our daughter and her friend to share. They both said it was very good as well and the size generous. The only disappointment was the chips and guacamole. The chips were thicker and harder than we like, and the guacamole, although fresh, was blended to a very smooth consistency, not a single chunk in sight, and was somewhat bland. Adding the juice of a lime segment (several of which are included with each meal) and salt fixed the flavor. This place was a pleasant surprise and I'll definitely be back for the ceviche, if nothing else. Thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers!",,,,,,
-1,"Dear Redfin Blues,\n\nI can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the \""list\"". To which she replied \""what list?\"" And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up.",,,,,,
-1,"Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.\n\nA co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.\n\nI got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.\n\nI won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road.",,,,,,

1,"Romance. T. Cook's has it in spades, so much so that the Royal Palms, the hotel that it is located in, has a \""Director or Romance\"". Now how great a job would that be . . . . and guys- no more wondering what to do to impress- just call up and they will take care of it all. \n\nWant rose petals scattered about your table? No problem. How about a poem reader? Got it. Or a private violinist? Again- they will make it happen. They will even put together a private dinner out in the garden for you. \""Ahh. Romance\"", she says wistfully while thinking about her evening. \n\nBut I digress . . .all this talk of romance has overshadowed why I always choose T Cooks for dinner every time I head to the Scottsdale area. It's the food, the bar, the service and of course the ambiance. \n\nEnter this historic Mediterranean villa and you know you are in for a special evening. To the right, the restaurant, to the left, the bar. And not just any bar. Live music is always playing and the bartenders (Jason and Jeremy) are terrific. You can eat at the bar (they have a separate bar menu) but my advice is to wait and eat in the main restaurant. \n\nUsually I ask to sit outdoors- either in the front courtyard around the trickling fountain, or in the back, Tuscan styled gardens. On this night- it was a little cool so we compromised and took a seat by the windows looking out. \n\nWarm, fresh bread is placed on the table with a garlicky pesto sauce. Try not to eat too much as you'll want room for their wide variety of appetizers and entrees. \n\nWe went with the charcuterie plate, plenty of meats and cheeses to start. As for our entree's the sliced ribeye was the pick of the night. But there are plenty of choices from chops, to fish to lamb. \n\nService was spot on (friendly, accommodating, and attentive) and we even got to meet the \""Director of Romance\"", Robert, who made me wish I had known about this service before. Robert asked if we were staying in the hotel (we weren't) for if we were- he said he could work his magic on our room while we ate. It made me want to change hotels, if only for the night! \n\nOur evening ended back where it began at the bar listening to old Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra tunes being crooned out by an amazing duo, while sipping a tawny port and reflecting on the dinner we had just experienced. \n\nThis is not a cheap date.  Dinner for two was around $200 but worth every penny.  Go ahead, splurge.  It's worth it.\n\nAhh. Romance. If you were wondering where it went in your life- check out T. Cooks at the Royal Palms Hotel. It's there, waiting for you.",,,,,,
1,"I went here with some friends last weekend to use a Groupon (4 people, shoe rental and 1 hour unlimited for 15$ woohoo!). I thought it was nicer than some other bowling alleys in Phoenix. The shoes were fairly new, which is always pleasant, the balls were organized by weight in a clear fashion, which was also nice. The only problem was the game froze a couple of times and the time kept ticking away, so we lost out on some time BUT at the end of our hour (of speed bowling) we only had a few frames left on our last game and the guys there gave us an extra 10 minutes for free to finish up, so that was very nice. I would come back here.",,,,,,

Area was rundown, shop area had empty shelves and limited selection of sizes, and the fun was average.\n\nDecent for drinks or watching sports but don't make a mecca for this place.

1,"The selection and service of this store is amazing.  I made two trips into the store.  First to look at the appliances, second to verify and order.  The staff is very knowledgeable and I felt absolutely no pressure to buy.  Before my purchase the installers came out to verify the opening sizes to see if modifications had to be made.  Once I had selected all of my new appliances our installation was scheduled.  The installers did have to modify our existing openings but they did an excellent job.  Our granite had to be cut on the sides as well as the oven opening.  One installer cut, the other ran two vacuums to minimize the dust.  Excellent job!  I am very impressed with the entire experience with Best Home Appliances.",,,,,,

-1,"I used to go here frequently, but I got sick of being charged for every extra thing (peppers, sour cream, etc).  In the end Chipotle ends up being higher quality AND cheaper if you get the extras.  On top of that, their hours are all over the place.  Chipotle is open more frequently.\n\nThe only reason to go here now is the Queso burrito, but the downsides outweigh the good.  It's worth waiting in line at Chipotle.",,,,,,

Waiting for 10 minutes at the bar, gave up and went inside, waited for another 15, nothing...They didn't even have tub girls set up....Bad planning.  We went down the street to cooperstown and although they were slammed, they had servers and we were able to get beverages before the show,  I would never go back to jackson's again.",,,,,,
-1,"I did some research, saw great reviews for this place and decided to try while on a trip. I love fried chicken, biscuts and potatoes so thought this was right up my alley.\n\nI went for breakfast.  The service was fast, but bottom line I wasnt impressed with the food. I got the fried chicken biscut with potatoes.  The fried chicken really didnt have any great flavor or juiciness to it. Yes the biscuts were good. The potatoes were like tater tots. Not what I expected for breakfast and nothing better than the average tater tot. No ketchup? I went back and asked for hot sauce which made it all tollerable. It wasnt horrible, it just wasnt great. \n\nIf you're looking for great fried chicken I wouldn't say this is the place.",,,,,,

Not just the typical lower end American Cuisine  (burger/fries/fried chicken tenders/fried fish..) that you get at any Walmart. Service was not bad. I only wrote this review, because I think this place has a huge potential, but I think it needs that  kitchen TV Show to come by and completely change it upside down. :)",,,,,,
-1,"I came here with a group of friends before going to the Checkers game, a group of 6 people. We were sat in a booth that was a little cramped, but the place was busy so we didn't mind. \n\nBeing an after work event, our group got there in 3 waves. From the time we sat down until the last person got there was probably 10 minutes. The waitress was so impatient. As soon as the last person sat down she came over and asked if we knew what we wanted to eat. Well... yes some of us that had been there knew, but the one who just sat down (my husband) had not even had the chance to look at the menu. \n\nFrom there it only went downhill. I got the impression she was angry with us because she was just not very nice. She didn't come back to the table after that for 20 minutes. I got the Fresh House Made Mozzarella Sandwich and it was just a sad sandwich. It sounded so good, but the ingredients were wimpy. There wasn't enough tomato (which were not ripe) to cover the bread, and there were maybe 2 shreds of onion. There was nothing fresh about it. \n\nI also ordered an Angry Orchard Cider (not on the menu) which I had to ask if there were any ciders. The waitress did not say the price but beware they are $5.75. Too expensive in my mind for that drink (but what could I do at that point?). \n\nThe location is convenient, but I would much rather go to Queen City Q.",,,,,,

Actually, I went in to use the bathroom, but $37.94 later, I walked out with the ingredients for our dinner in my hand!\n\nReally, I want to say THANK YOU to Marty.  Who's Marty, you ask?  Marty is the guy who works behind the meat counter.  He also happens to work behind the seafood counter.  He also happens to have experience as a chef.  Marty was incredibly helpful and friendly to little old me who had no clue what to buy for dinner let alone how to prepare it!\n\nMarty chose 3 perfect pieces of halibut, and I could tell he was excited when I asked his opinion on how to prepare it.  I knew I could trust him when he asked me all of the important questions including the following:\n-Who was I cooking for?\n-What was I planning on serving with the fish?\n-How did I plan on cooking the fish?\nI knew I was in good hands when he revealed to me that he has experience as a chef...\n\nSo, I followed Marty's advice, and my brother, BF, and I enjoyed a marvelous, home cooked meal!  We had baked sweet potatoes, asparagus, and halibut... and I know you are curious how I prepared the halibut.  \n\nOk - below is what Marty told me and it came out perfectly!\nI lightly drizzled olive oil onto the fish and put it in the oven on 350 for approximately 8 minutes alongside the asparagus which I drizzled with olive oil and salt also.  While in the oven, I concocted a tomato/calamata olive relish that I put on top of the fish while it baked for the final few minutes.\n\nThe boys enjoyed it immensely.  We had a nice bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay to go along with it.  Perfection!  \n\nThanks again, Marty - you rock!",,,,,,

I ended up being very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThis is a real nice place, run by a very nice couple who did an amazing job on a pair of shoes I brought in - the worn shoes I brought in look like new.  Better than new, even.  Great service all-around.  I highly recommend The Leatherman if you need some shoe work done.",,,,,,
1,"Very cool venue for live music, mainly because it's small and you can easily interact with the artists. There's also seating, so if you get there early enough, you can get a seat. The pricing seems like it varies depending on who performs. I got to go for free so no complaints from me. They have a bar in the back and there is plenty of parking. When I was watching rehearsal, it seemed like the artists were having trouble adapting to the sound resonating back onto the stage, but once it went live, they sounded amazing. \n\nI saw a smoking area, which I didn't go out to, but I assume is where the patio seating is. I also didn't use the bathroom so I don't know how clean it is. \n\nOne of my favorite venues from Phoenix, since I haven't found many that I like",,,,,,
-1,"Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although, when you go inside, it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here, which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day, which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself, but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good, the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there.",,,,,,

1,"Went back to this OG tonight. Interesting show.\n\nAs I was walking up to the table, I saw server Crag (mentioned in my first review) was waiting on the tables around us. So before he could greet us, I said to the others in my party \""we need to get moved to a different section\"". Apparently, the hostess had told someone else in my party that we had a different server, so we settled in and watched to see how things went.\n\nOur excellent server tonight was Kayla. She did a great job. We gave her a diverse set of requests with our order, and she met all of them perfectly. She was attentive, friendly, suggested several upgrades, and generally continued to restore my faith in this location (like Adam and Joey had done before her). Her tip reflected it.\n\nMeanwhile, I watched the tables around us get ignored by Crag again. I thought it was sad that he was still working there, and still meeting his especially low level of expectations that he set for us when we were unfortunately sat in his section. Except this time, there was a manager going around asking the tables if they were happy with their service and food. The tables on both sides of us said the service was really slow and had some other complaints about wrong orders, unfilled glasses, and missing utensils. One of the tables was seated at the same time as us, and in the entire time they were there, Crag showed up exactly twice. The manager had to comp their meal. Not sure how Crag is still working there, especially since there are so many good servers working there, and especially since Crag is costing them money now with his consistently bad performance.\n\nAnyway, the food was good as usual.\n\nI do recommend this location now, and if you ask for Adam's, Joey's, or Kayla's sections, you'll be very happy with the service.\n\nOne last point: kudos to the manager (I didn't get his name, but he had short blonde hair and was a consummate professional); he did a really good job of making the customers happy (especially Crag's victims), and he kept the dining room flowing. Nice work!",,,,,,
1,"I am visiting from out of state and went here based only on Siri listing it when I asked for a BBQ restaurant. Btw, plenty of parking. When I entered, a pleasant gentleman was wiping tables and he greeted me with a smile and a pleasantness that clearly was natural. He helped me get a take-out menu and suggested several choices. A young man working there was also quite pleasant and I never saw anyone on their cell phone like I have so many times in other restaurants. My food came quickly, was hot, the order was correct, and most importantly, tasted delicious. I am glad I stopped there.",,,,,,
1,"It's a few short nervous blocks from the freeway.  Inside, it is a world of color, a world, of textures, a world of flavor (this is a pretty, pretty, vibrant interior - -  a complete world of fun if you weren't into the serious business of eating lunch).\n\nI completely simpled out  when ordering and simply got the Mar Y Tierra  (surf & turf - - a stir-fry-up of strip steak and gobsmackingly richly embroidered shrimp).   The little tortilla that came as an appertizer-thingy with the meal was like tiny cubes of chunk tuna in a vinegar-like sauce.   The big plate with fine beans,  some salad accents,  and the incendiary steak&mind-blowing shrimp was super delicious.   A twenty covered it including tip.  Anytime, anywhere, take me back and please let me try some more menu items.",,,,,,
1,"Amazing!  From start to finish this place was incredible.  Great french host (Mgr?).   Great french waiter, helpful and funny.   The support staff was way above average always, plates cleared and drinks filled in a timely manner. \n\nI REALLY like the fact they don't rush you and try to flip tables, we were there about two hours. \n\nThis is a quaint little stand alone restaurant that also has a small bar and a few tables out on the patio.

1,My son graduated from HS and i decided to take him somewhere special. When i brought up the name Outback Steakhouse he was all over it! the people here were friendly and the food was great. we were served quickly and we were out in time to catch the movie we were going to see,,,,,,
-1,"I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha.",,,,,,
1,"I'm not sure what  that \""liberal NY'er\"" is talking about on her review but this place was magical and I am from NY and NJ!\n\nFirst off, its an actual authentic old western town. It is so charming it's not even funny!! \n\nThe mine tour was fun and the tour guide was an angel. My sister passed out at the start of the tour and he stopped the tour and helped her back upstairs to the ice cream parlor ,got her water and a dr. and stayed with us to make sure she was ok. He was super friendly, sweet and for the first part of the tour I saw explained what all the tools were in the mine, how they were used and everything else you could possibly want to know about those days. His name was Chris BTW! \n\nWe got there late in the day so sadly everything was closed but the saloon by the time my sister was up to par again so we went to have dinner and watch the musician. I ordered the flat iron steak and backed potatoe and my sister being a vegetarian ordered a grilled cheese and fries. I ordered my steak rare which RARELY ever comes that way but it did and it was tender and juicy. The waitress was friendly and the musician was fantastic! The decor was so spot on and made me feel like I was back in those days! \n\nWe really wanted to see everything so we came back the next morning and went to all the shops. We got our pictures taken in old western wear and the woman was sooo friendly and dressed us up exactly how we were imagining! The gift shop had tons of neat little things like cactus candy, windchimes, and homemade TASTY fudge!! We visited the patry shop and the iced mocha I had was great. \n\nWe decided to try the train tour instead of venturing to the mine again and when the sweet woman at the counter heard what happened the day before she gave us free tickets. Whiplash was the train conductor and he was as friendly as can be. We had talked to him earlier in the day in the pastry shop and when we realized he was the conductor we were all delighted to see each other. His tour was very informative. He talked about how the mine started, who took it over, how it progressed over the years and how it came to be a ghost town! We took a TON of really fun pictures! \n\nThe bordello wasnt open yet when we were there since it was early but nect time im up in that area im definitely going back. ALSO, they said that they hold weddings there and let me tell you, if the day ever came where I was getting married I would absolutely have it there. Theres a cute little church and horseback rides!\n\nIt was truly a magical place that I enjoyed more than I ever thought I would. It made my first ever girls weekend truly special!!",,,,,,
-1,"Placed a take-out order of vegetable pakoras, shahi paneer, garlic naan, and papadum. Did not receive the pakoras at all, the naan was COLD (not even lukewarm), the papadum was burned, and the shahi paneer was crappy. As your lawyer, I advise you to become a patron of any other indian place in the valley but this one.",,,,,,

Thank you Salon Sandoval I look forward to my next visit !",,,,,,
-1,"i just finished a two year lease at the Heritage. honestly the only reason we stayed so long is that we were on the 3rd floor!!!! moving was a b---ch. the kitchen photo is the same as our units exactly. the dishwasher sucks big time! the pigeons overtake your balcony too.\n\nthis place is not built very well, they are constantly having blackouts and they do not compensate for lost food or anything (however one time they did put us up at a hotel). there is no bike rack and you cannot leave your bikes chained anywhere outside your apartment. the security gates are always stuck open, so anyone can come in. several of the residents are continual beggars and bummers of cigarettes and coins who loiter around the mail boxes.\n\nhowever i loved the pool area; as hardly anyone ever used it while i was there. i did have some great pool parties, but there isn't a restroom by the pool, so it was a constant hike upstairs for the loo. \n\nthe windows are so thin, that you hear each passing wind, bird and rattle from your neighbors doors closing shut. i would not recommend this place unless you can deal with the blackouts, beggars and continual shake of the window. if your an east coaster, this might be the place for you; because you can hear everything your neighbor is doing in their place too!",,,,,,
1,"Mom and Aunt were in town, my Aunt wanted to come here so on there way back home we all stopped off! Now I had no idea, that my 60 yr old aunt had the intention of ordering the Big Unit! I was shocked!!! Yes, we all had out share of it. But my Aunt Sue was game and actually ate most of it!! I had the Rob Zombie Burger! It was great, cheese burger with guac, salsa, and bacon!! All had a great time, and yes again, we will be back!!",,,,,,
-1,"Are you a douche bag?  Do you have more money than sense?  Does it make you all warm and fuzzy to way overpay for a mediocre drink?  If so, Majerle's is the place for you!  \n\nPersonally, I never cared for the \""owner\"" when he was with the Suns, and this establishment has done nothing to change that opinion.  The food is bland at best, but for the prices it should have a little flavor.  I'm not sure what criteria the staff uses when deciding who to grace with their presence, but the female servers sure weren't responding to me (a woman) even when I held out a $20.00 - my 6'3\"" friend had much better luck, he was the one that had to order my drink.  \n\nI'm disappointed, this is such an easy place to hit on a light rail pub crawl or before or after a game or concert, but I just don't think I can bring myself to go back willingly.",,,,,,
1,"They carry such a great selection of healthy foods, and always have a sampling table of something great!\n\nThe prices are awesome too!",,,,,,
1,"Exceptional Italian sandwiches like no other you have ever tried. I cannot compare to anything from Italy as I have never traveled there, but I am sold on the authenticity at Pane Bianco. \n\nThe menu is limited but it allows them to knock it out of the park on what they do offer. The flat bread is made right there in the oven central to the shop, and tastes great, there seems to be a pinch of salt tossed on at the very end that gives the bread a great finish. \n\nThe sandwich I enjoyed was filled with sopressata and mozzarella which ranked with the best I have ever had. \n\nAll around an extremely worth while stop for anyone who loves Italian deli food, Do not pass on the candy that comes with the meal!",,,,,,
-1,"Based on Yelp reviews, we dined at this restaurant recently on a double date. The building itself is adorable. Maybe used to be an old house? It's cozy and you feel like you will be served some home cookin' with a twist. Our appetizer of spinach artichoke dip was delicious but the meal declined after the beginning. My husband and I both ordered the chile relleno. The description looked fantastic but the polenta was bland and the chile itself (for not being heavily fried) was very greasy and left me wanting. One of our friends ordered the crab cakes which he described as fine. \n\nToward the end of our meal, a gnat was discovered floating in a Manhattan at our table. Our server was notified, she took the drink away after asking if our friend wanted a replacement (he declined) and we waited for our check. The drink was still included on the check and the waitress seemed a bit surprised when he asked for it to be removed. \n\nI think the reason I was so disheartened about this experience was we still ended up paying about $70 for our meal (just for myself and my hubs.) Unfortunately, Coronado is not worth the food, price or overall experience.",,,,,,
1,"This is in our rotation of restaurants that our family of 5 visits regularly.  Is it authentic mexican food?  no.  But then again - hubby does not like true Mexican dishes...This is Tex Mex food.  The one thing we order off on the menu - and that really are top notch, are the fajitas.  Husband has ordered them everywhere - and really, here they are the best.  Mango Margaritas and chips and salsa are pretty good too!",,,,,,
-1,"This is the kind of place you find in a mall.  Fast food salad, pasta and pizza.  I had a salad/pizza combo.  The pizza was cold and the crust had a weird metallic taste.  The salad was your standard plate of bland greens.  With all the offices and the hospital nearby, you would think there would be better options for lunch in this shopping plaza. Nope.  That's why I always end up at the Good Egg.  It's hard to screw up an omlette. Despite the high convenience factor, I will not be back.",,,,,,
1,I hadn't heard of Nello's until recently and it is now my favorite restaurant in the valley! Awesome pizza and the house dressing is equally as good. Great service most of the time and I need to try their happy hour soon.,,,,,,
-1,"Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar, but good luck getting served.  If it is crowded or the bar is just full I've always had to wait to get served.\n\nThe beer selection is decent, but not all that big.  For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road.\n\nThe best part is the patio, if you want decent food and good outdoor seating, Harris is a good choice - if you don't mind waiting.",,,,,,
-1,"Not a great selection of beer for a place called a \""Draught Emporium\"".  Also the food was less than mediocre and they were out both chicken tenders and pizza when we were there.  There are a lot of much better places to get craft beer and bar food in Charlotte.",,,,,,
1,"Case# 25       Food of my childhood\n\nI have been eating these subs since I was a little kid. My mom (R.I.P) used bring me here and it is one of the few childhood memories I hang on to. For those who do not know about this place as the food detective I will share a little background info from my case files to help you out. \n\nMr. Submarine is actually a small chain that really got it's start here in the valley in the early 80's. At one time the locations stretched from the east valley to west phoenix. With increased competition from larger sub chains ( Subway, Cousins, Blimpy, and Quiznos they were forced to limit their growth and use word of mouth advertising to keep customers coming in. This resulted in store closings and now only two locations remain open. When you try and compare a place like this to say a subway which spends big time money to advertise their five dollar foot long special, or their new breakfast sandwich there is no competition. \n\nThis place wins by a mile. Who needs a 5 dollar foot long that is served by some teenager who only cares about his shift ending so he can escape. No, I would rather have the owner there serving me a sandwich that he himself is going to eat for lunch. Don't give me slimy meat and dried out looking cheese. I want soft fresh bread with toppings that enhance the other components of my sandwich not cover it up! OK enough with the ranting, this place is a no frills type of place. No wraps or cookies. They offer the normal meat choices including ham, turkey, tuna and your choice of bread ( white, wheat, and sourdough).\n\nNo annoying jingles or sandwich Nazis (read my subway review), just good food, made and served by someone who cares about what they are selling you.  They are open Monday through Friday 10am to 10pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 8pm.\n\nThey are a little more pricey than Subway but for a great sandwich and great service it is well worth the price.\n\nCase closed",,,,,,

She was the type of waitress that could anticipate what you would want to drink and never kept us waiting. It is a very chill, laid back environment, great for drinking the night away. the service was so impressive we never made it to the list of other places we wanted to try that night.",,,,,,
1,"Although it leans on the pricey side of Phoenix cuisine, Houston's is by far one of my favorite places to go out for a nice dinner. Their veggie burger is beyond amazing (I always get the couscous on the side which is also delicious).\n\nOn a recent trip, my boyfriend ordered the ribs on a recommendation. He said they were by far the best ribs he has ever enjoyed.",,,,,,
1,"I had the Chili Colorado and wow it was great!  I eat a lot of tex-mex so I wanted something different.  Beef in a stew with jalape\u00f1os, beans and rice. It came with flour tortillas.  Very tasty.  The beef was very tender and perfect.  Their beans and rice have a lot of flavor too.\n\nThe service is always very attentive and liberal with the free warm chips, salsa & warm bean dip... mmm.\n\nThe ambiance is typical tex-mex with Spanish themed items on the walls and bright colors.  This location is a bit cozy, but it has a nice feel.  I came in with a party of 10 and they were able to seat us quickly, our food came out quicker than expected and everyone enjoyed their meal.\n\nPlus they recently updated their menu to include pictures of ALL entries. Not everyone's thing but I appreciate it and so will your family.\n\nGrab a couple chocolate-mint candies as you leave.",,,,,,

1,"We've just discovered two new awesome dishes at Szechwan Palace -  the cumin covered lamb riblets on the Chinese menu as well as the Water Boiled Fish Filets on the regular menu.\n\nThe lamb riblets are coated with cumin and other spices, quick fried and then wok-fried with whole dried chilies, Szechwan numbing red peppercorns and caramelized onions.  This is a finger-lickin' tasty dish which you have to eat with your fingers unless you have amazing chopstick skills. \n\nThe Water Boiled dishes are a famous Szechwan classic which I don't know why I haven't ordered until today.  The plain name is quite misleading.  It's a clear soup boiled with an insane amount of chilies, more numbing peppercorns, Napa cabbage, a little celery, fermented beans and garnished with sprigs of coriander.  You have choice of meat and we chose fish today.  The filets are coated with cornstarch and quickfried to preserve it's moisture and tenderness before adding to the stew.  This is by far the spiciest and most flavorful dish I've had here so far.  I think I'm hooked.\n\nLet me stress that this restaurant excels at authentic Szechwan food, not American-style Chinese dishes or even Cantonese dishes.  Although the xiao long bao (Shanghainese soup buns) were surprisingly good.  I wonder if they share some dishes with the Shanghainese restaurant on the other side of Ranch Market, which was extremely quiet in contrast to Szechwan Palace which was packed with a weekday office lunch crowd.",,,,,,

1,This place is clean and Big a bit confusing but definitely different from the last time I flew out of here 6yrs ago! They did a great job with how everything is arranged here I think my favorite was the Baggage Claim - it reminded me of Vegas!! The fact that the Car Rental place has its own Garage and is organized so well says a lot!,,,,,,
1,"Somehow I came across this place on the internet. I believe it was a banner add, link or something. They deliver great steaks and grill items to your house. I have ordered the steak both times when I was in a hurry and it was almost like I just pulled it off my grill. They have a special sauce that is decent and allow the steak to finish cooking on it's way to your house in heat bags which seems to work pretty good. I guess they have been around awhile, but I just discovered them and will most likely order from them again.",,,,,,

-1,"Boy was I disappointed and embarrassed. I had friends visiting from out of state, and I told them that Honey Bear's was the best bbq in town. We arrived Sunday night around 7pm. They were out of ribs...My friends ordered the rib and chicken combo. One substituted the rib tips for the ribs,  and the other friend ordered sliced beef. I ordered a half lb of pulled pork and two sides. They ended up \""finding\"" some ribs for one of the orders, but there were obviously boiled or pressure-cooked and not slow smoked.. The chicken came out 10 minutes after the rest of the food, and it was also either microwaved or pressure cooked.. My food, (which was ordered a couple of minutes after theirs) took over 30 minutes to arrive.  I overheard them telling the people sitting behind me that they were out of almost everything..\n\nThen, to top it all off, we were overcharged.  We showed them a four square check in which was supposed to get me one free side, but I was still charged for both my sides. The cashier girl was new and obviously in WAY over her head. \n\nI was so embarrassed after raving about this place, to have it be so very bad...",,,,,,
1,The food was really good but their beans and rice side for a plate is ridiculously priced. The service was horrible! Waited forever get a table because it said please wait to be seated then to be told go pick out what table you want. Took almost 15 mins to get chips. And our waitress was rude and didn't check on us once until it was time to pay. She didn't ask if we wanted refills or a box for the 3$ beans and rice we got.,,,,,,

Plus the owners are very sweet and believe in customer service!  I called yesterday to order a cake for today (a half sheet fresh mango cake), and they said that they might not have enough fresh ripe mangoes for a half sheet.  But since that was the cake I wanted, they said they would go out and purchase mangoes (ripe) to make the cake in time!  That was super sweet of the owner to go out of his way to help me out!

I picked up my vacuum that same day and it's been working great so far.

We had no problems finding a seat at the bar. \n\nThey have a great deal everyday of any glass of wine is $5. We had a few glasses of wine and had The Butcher's Block for an appetizer. Very good mix of goodies for sure. It always had a nice ambiance and great prices. \n\nSince it's starting to cool off I know I'll be back a bit more.,,,,,,
-1,"So I thought reading their menu, seeing it in Chinese language and in the \nChinese District . . . it could be a real find -- I love dives with surprisingly good food.\n\n I was soooooo disappointed.\n\nThe egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm.  A minute after my soup\nwas served, my main course came out.  It had two items--pea pods and pork.  Not very BBQ flavor, rather a funny flavor.  No other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots.  The minimal sauce was very bland.  The rice was not fresh.",,,,,,
-1,"I think this should be more like 1.5 stars. I got a 6-pack of tamales. They were more expensive than I would've guessed (I sort of had to, considering they weren't priced). First I open the package and low-and-behold this bag of six tamales, in fact, contains only five! The filling is fine, but the masa blows. It is dry and gritty. The preparation instructions seem questionable (microwave in a plastic bag? Really?). I'm saving the remaining ones for when I'm too drunk to care about anything. The tortillas are still worth it.",,,,,,

Atria's is one of those places that I've never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matter.\n\nI can't say the food is bad, but it's not really great either. I will say the service is always so. It's almost as if they don't realize you have other places to go; you can just sit at their restaurant all day. On the upside the busboy's and girls are hounding your table filling your water glass after taking a sip. So if you're a horse you won't go thirsty.\n\nHonestly though. you are better off eating the park. I mean who doesn't love Manny's BBQ?",,,,,,

Once a dependable choice for a good meal, it's now hit or miss. You can't even count on them having an acceptable sanitation grade.  Our lunch there yesterday may have turned us off for good.",,,,,,

1,Very helpful. Knew exactly what I needed (a grappling hook) and pointed me in the right direction. I will use them again. Very nice.,,,,,,
1,"I enjoy eating here frequently, my favorite is the White Sands Chimichanga, it  is always good I have not had a bad meal here ever. The staff is friendly and the service is excellent. I also recommend their chili relleno.  Their prices are moderate and the portions are generous. If you want good New Mexico style mexican food in Phoenix, this is the place. Every part of the meal is good. No canned beans or tasteless rice here.",,,,,,

1,"Very thorough, I was referred here for a mole patrol last year and went here for a follow up a year after.  On my follow up 15 minutes later, I was checked head to toe and given the all clear.  No cancer, and they provided an good explanation of some hyper pygmentation on my ankles.  I'm not giving up my ankle socks, but appreciate the explanation.  From this fair skinned man, thanks Camelback Dermatology.",,,,,,
1,This isn't a bad place to go and get a beer and some grub.\nAlthough I'm not really sure why it's categorized under pizza\n(Since pizza isn't even on the menu)\nThe menu consists mainly of burgers wings and sandwiches \nThe prices are reasonable \nStaff seems friendly \nThe decor looks like every guys idea of a bar in his garage \nI'll definitely be back again,,,,,,
-1,I really didn't care for the breakfast steak biscuits.  The meat patty was coated and then deep fried.  It was impossible to tell what type of meat it was.  Eating it between the biscuits....it was like oil on oil.  The biscuit itself was ok.  But I would not go there for breakfast.,,,,,,
-1,If you are a South Park yuppie you will love it. If not stay away. Nuff said.\n\nStaff is rude. And they are idiots,,,,,,
-1,"I used to go here all the time for lunch to get their mini deep dish pizzas that are limited in supply and you better get there early because they go quick...because they are sooo good and they can feed two people almost.  But went there with the family last night and  you know how it can be kinda difficult to satisfy 4 people with the same pizza?  So we often do half and half to make everybody happy...and we've never ran into this situation, they wanted to charge as if the whole pizza had all the toppings...meaning if you get 3 toppings on one side and 3 different toppings on the other side, you better be prepared to pay for a 6 topping pizza...about $8 extra.  So they are off the 'family friendly' list for me.",,,,,,
-1,Not crazy about this place.,,,,,,
-1,"Recently had lunch at Cosmos Cafe in uptown. I ordered the Steak Frites and wasn't asked how I'd like the steak cooked. It came prepared okay, but the meat was exceptionally gristly.\n\nFood and service alone would be a perfectly average 3-stars. However, we were seated next to some piece of wall art at a two-top. A large flying type of bug (flying ant, maybe?) made it's way onto our table twice, from underneath the wall art. I flicked it to the floor, and about two minutes later, another one emerged from behind the art, hovering next to our table. I could imagine the first one was a wayward insect that had flown in the restaurant, but when I saw a second one I began to suspect that there might be an infestation in the restaurant. I won't be dining at this Cosmos location again.",,,,,,
-1,"A very friendly, true Frenchman. A very proud owner. Curbside appeal is non existent. The interior is inviting & charming. The pastry display is disappointing & a bit unkept, but makes up in true cultural flavor. Although only three stars, hoping to see this business supported.",,,,,,
-1,"This place is downright bizarre.  it's run by the same people who run Greek Isles, which means most of the menu is Greek with some pasta and \""creole\"" items.  I say \""creole\"" because there is like 2 items on the menu that are supposed to be New Orleans style and those at the tables around us who ordered the special (chicken creole) left most of it on their plate. \n\nI had a caesar salad and it, I kid you not, comes out in a mixing bowl.  it's huge and really a total waste of salad because it would take 3-4 people to finish one.  I barely made a dent in it.  The salad was just alright, nothing terribly impressive.  \n\nDuring the week it's full of blue shirts watching ESPN.",,,,,,
1,"This is one of our all time favorite family restaurants.  The selection is fantastic and all the food is high quality.  All you can eat Asian food, sushi and Mongolian BBQ, plus desert,....how can you beat that?  Staff is friendly and attentive.",,,,,,
-1,"I've eaten slices from three different cakes from Carl's Cakes, and none of them were drop-dead wonderful. In fact, they were all similar: cake pretty average, all topped with a very strange frosting -- buttercream that is TOO buttery, overpowering in both flavor and fragrance, and has an odd, chemical-like flavor to it. \n\nAfter I eat a slice of the cake, I'm not tempted to go back for more. (It's cake! You should be!) Because of the strange buttercream frosting, I've really had enough when I've eaten just one small slice.\n\nEvery instance in which I've had a slice of a Carl's Cakes cake was at my work (someone's birthday or other event). The cakes sat in the kitchen room at my work, ready for staff people to enjoy. The kitchen room itself smelled like butter with the cake sitting in the room. It is a sickly sweet smell and kind of nauseating, I think. (I've never noticed other sheet cakes from other cake bakers that cause the room to fill with the smell of the frosting.)\n\nI hate to be harsh about cakes, but I just have never had an enjoyable experience eating any cakes from Carl's Cakes.",,,,,,
1,"Went there for mini date. Had the sea bass I believe. Boyfriend had the steak Thai noodle. The best dish ever! Even better than mines and it wasn't bad for $15 bucks. But there menu doesn't have much, they couldn't make me a sex on the beach :(",,,,,,
1,"This place is worth 4 stars due to the history, architecture and view. If you want a unique experience for a birthday/anniversary ect...this is the place. The restaurant on site had great service, but food was average. I'm not dying to go back for the food, but man do they have a great basil/lemon gimlet. WOW. Come here if you want to go back in time to the 30's for a nice dinner and/or drink. I will be back!",,,,,,
-1,"This place had a flood so they ran fans all night.  My sink had a dirty ring that was a different color than the rest of the counter around the entire sink.  My room was not very clean.  My view is of a power plant.  The white trash people around the pool kept cursing around children, and management refused to do anything about.  This place is a trash pit.",,,,,,
-1,"I'm simply not a fan of this place and don't plan on going back so let me explain why... \n\nLast fall, before a panthers game I came here and had a pretty decent lunch-I had a tasty buffalo chicken wrap with fries and two Bloody Mary's (yes it was one of those Sundays) and all was good. I left for the game with a decent memory of Presto. \n\nFast forward to the new owners and disappointed is the best word that comes to mind. First, I met a co-worker for a quick lunch, which meant I wasn't hungover or imbibing, so it was a much more objective assessment. I paged through a menu that has a serious identity crisis from mediterranean to American to italian pasta dishes to typical bar food and settled on a chicken gyro sandwich...when in doubt, I always go the specialty cuisine. When it arrived it had tzatziki on the side (good) and some weird, greasy dressing drizzled inside (not good). To make things worse, after my first taste, I almost sent it back to say I ordered chicken, thinking they gave me fish...but them realized the consistency was chicken with a really bad taste. \n\nNonetheless, I ate the pita bread and wilted greens I got for a side salad and split...with a stomach ache to follow.  \n\nI really try to give places more than one try before writing a bad review but you couldn't pay me to go back for another try",,,,,,
1,"Great little dive bar. Strong, cheap drinks and the best wings in town :)",,,,,,
-1,"1.5 / 5 - Beef Pho: Kind of bland tasting\n2.0 / 5 - Pork Chop: Not much meat and as much flavor as I'm used to, but still good.",,,,,,
1,"This place has the cutest and quirkest little items for sale, a great place to shop for a gift for a mom, sister, or friend! I always love the selection of cards they have too.\n\nOn top of that, their bakery case is AMAZING. I'm not a huge fan of their cookies (I like mine to be more moist and chewy, theirs tend to be drier and crumblier), but I like their tres leches cake and the old-timer cupcake (the one that looks like a big Hostess cupcake). Their gelato is really good too and made in-house with no preservatives or anything weird like that. My favorite flavor is the peach, although the mint is also interesting. Just be forewarned that it's REALLY minty, like really really really minty with actual chunks of mint leaves in it. might be good to eat on a date so you can have super fresh breath for that goodnight smooch! haha!\n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the parking situation is ridiculous. I know they have a valet who will park your car for you and they validate the valet ticket so you don't have to pay the $3, but it's still an inconvenience! last time I came I had to wait almost 15 min in a long line of cars, boo.",,,,,,
-1,"Luna held a sale in the Parkroad shopping center last week and I think it is even going through this week.  They are calling it \""Luna Rack\"" as they basically took a big bite off of Nordstrom Rack.  \n\nAnyway, the truth of the matter is that it should be called Luna Wack because that pretty much describes the scene.  They are mostly offering tank and tube tops for $60 and calling it a deal.  The quality of the clothing was pathetic and most of the items were ugly.  I know it is like shopping a sale rack but still..\n\nThere were a couple cute summer dresses but everything else was hideous and still overpriced.  \n\nIt would be a great place for a teeny bopper looking for some type of club clothes...otherwise, don't bother.",,,,,,
-1,"Don't waste your money here. They love to find any reason to charge you extra fees. The front office is rude and doesn't ever return your phone calls or do what you ask them to do. They turn off the heat during summer months and turn off the AC in October even though its still in the 100s out. They had NO heat or AC almost the entire month of November and we still had to pay full rent. That is ILLEGAL. It was 105 and I had no AC, then it got down to 40 degrees at night and there was no heat so I had to keep my oven on to stay warm. I complained to the office and they just made up excuses to why they couldnt turn it on for a month. I was constantly having problems with losing hot water and water pressure. Ive had to call security there because neighbors were outside night after night fighting and hitting each ither and seciurity refused to come because they \""dont deal with violence\"". are you kidding me?? whats the point of security?  I've never had such aggravations living at a place. I will never ever recommend this place to anyone. Worst experience ever.",,,,,,
1,"Found this place online and decided to take a chance and try it on Tuesday night. The drive north on Central had me a little worried until I got about a block away. What a relief to see a trendy, cozy, but still airy sort of place. Exactly what I wanted in a nice wine bar. My friend and I felt fine in nice jeans and cute tops.\n\nThis particular day they had a great special. We got a bottle of La Posta wine (I think that was the name) and 4 pieces of bruschetta for $20. The wine was recommended by the waiter...he knew what he was talking about. We got the bruschetta with apples, figs and brie; salmon and capers; prosciutto with figs & marscapone and the last had salami on it. The apple bruschetta was my favorite.\n\nI'll be back and will take more friends to experience the food, wine and atmosphere.",,,,,,
-1,"Terrible coffee.  So bitter I would have to dump a quarter cup of cream and several heaping tablespoons of sugar into this cup-a-joe to overpower the flavor...  but at that point, why wouldn't I go all out and find myself a milkshake or some other creamy sugary treat?  \r\n\r\nThe muffins are the size of your head.  Lots of calorie-laden treats.  I had some carrot cake once and it had that stale refrigerator flavor in the icing.  What a waste. \r\n\r\nMy advice, walk across the street to Starbucks. At least you'll get a mediocre cup of coffee instead of a bad one.",,,,,,
1,"This place is amazing. You wouldn't even know it's there when you are driving by. It's in a very unassuming location, tucked back in the corner of a little strip mall. It's very small, but has huge charm. Their Pad Thai is so good. Also, though it seems like an Asian restaurant,  they also serve Italian food.  Best chicken marsala I have ever had. And they have a great happy hour. Try the potstickers, they are to die for.",,,,,,
1,"LOCATION:  Downtown Phoenix - walking distance from the stadiums! \n\nATMOSPHERE:  Very lively with great energy for a Saturday afternoon!  There were several flat screen TVs with music videos playing...not too loud.  A couple of other screens along the wall had the local March Madness basketball games playing.  We were there three hours before the Lady Gaga concert, and the other patrons were fun and diverse!  \n\nFOOD:  We had the \""Big Cheese Burger\"" and \""Grilled Veggie Sandwich.\""  For drinks, we were excited to have a \""Bahama Mama\"" and \""Blackberry Smash!\""  I was sad when I found out they were out of the Balsamic Tomato Bruschetta.  We ate every bite!!  There was not a crumb remaining!  VERY GOOD!\n\nPARKING:  There is a parking garage just a couple of blocks away.  We were staying at a hotel which included parking in the garage; therefore, I'm not sure of the garage rates.  I would recommend parking there when in the area.    \n\nPERKS:  Location, location, location!\n\nSERVICE:  The waitress was friendly and very efficient.  Even though it was getting busier each minute we were there, she was very responsive to our table!  VERY happy!\n\nCONCLUSION:  For event nights, DEFINITELY get there at 5 pm.  If you wait until 6 pm or later, it will be quite crowded.  The location alone makes this place perfect for dinner and drinks before attending games/concerts.  I will be back!",,,,,,

1,"T. Cook's is a gem in the Royal Palms Hotel. We recently stayed at the Royal Palms, (which deserves its own review) for a week and dined at T. Cook's 4 times! Once for lunch, three times for dinner, including Christmas which was excellent despite the busy the dining room.\n\nThe setting, both indoors and out is charming. The food was great and we had the best paella since visiting Spain.  Chef Lee treated us royally. We can't wait to get back to Phoenix to return to T. Cook's.",,,,,,
1,"I was turned on to Neds when I was in High School and am a fan. Its a good value. I believe the last time I went, an 8: sub with side and drink was like 5.00. Wayyy better than subway. I like just the traditional turkey sammich with lettuce, tomato, onion and lots of mayo. The reason they are not rated \""as good as it gets\"" is because every time I have gone there, there is not enough mayo on the sammich. Make sure you ask for extra unless you want a dry sub. Their potato salad is terrific and might be the best I have ever had. The service is quick and friendly and the facility is clean but a bit plain. Give it a try if your looking for a new sammich spot. \n\nPS: Their catering is great too. They always include everything and instead of giving little packets of mayo, mustard, oil, vinigar, they give you actual bottles.   :O",,,,,,
-1,"I was entirely underwhelmed by the supposed \""best burger\"" in Pittsburgh, as it had been recommended to me.  I guess I was expecting more flavor - some kind of house seasoning or something special, but it was very ordinary.  \n\nIt was quite busy and seemed a little cramped inside.  They seated us near the window facing LIberty, which was great - but the way the seating was arranged, my friend had her back to it.  I generally prefer  tables perpendicular to the window which allow everyone to look out occasionally without craning their neck.\n\nI'm hesitant to go back, because the burger was the best-sounding thing on the menu and it wasn't that great.",,,,,,
1,The programs offered at Young Champions of America are incredible for so many reasons.  They are very affordable and the instructors pay great attention to each student.

-1,"I boarded my dogs here and spent thousands of dollars with this place because of our travel schedule. I  lost a lot of money with my business and couldn't afford to get my dogs. When we called they said no payment, no dogs. Ok, I understand but then they tried to say we had abandoned the dog's. They would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan. They shipped all 3 of my dogs off and won't say where they are. I understand they wanted their money. They sent us to collections and gave my dogs away and said it was in the contract that we signed that they can do that. They said they have no idea where the dogs are now.  When I say we spent a lot of money with them, it was thousands over time when you are paying for multiple dogs. My issue is if you are going to ship my dogs off you could have given them to me and work something out and they never told me they were shipping the dogs off. They told us after they shipped them off! I had to give one star rating but only because u have to.",,,,,,
-1,"I'm kind of shocked.  \n\nI'm an Arizona-born-native and I've been to the Zoo and the Zoolights over SEVERAL decades.  I've been bored out of my skull every time.  As an adult, I've attended these events with the youngsters because they somehow believe it's cool.  If you're looking to score husband-points, then, by all means, drag everyone there.  Your feet and legs will be sore from all the walking they make you do.  If you're looking for enjoyment, DO NOT BOTHER.  The sneaky and insidious problem is that this place is EXTREMELY expensive, and pretends that they are providing a service to the community.  Let me explain---  they truly believe that they are a worth-while value for every family dollar you're spending.  Yet, don't believe a salesman--- they wiil bend the truth every time, and smile at you while they take your dollar.  And now, on the the Big Three:\n\n1)  Price:  This is the absolute worst problem with this seemingly, family-friendly place.  I mean, who would think that a City Zoo would be trying to scalp you for cash?  Let me give you an example of a small family of 4... this can EASILY turn into a $100 day.  For a 6-8 person group of working-class families, this can easily reach over $150, and outside of a $50,000/yr income household.  If your kids bring friends, it will be even more.  You'll hear cashiers say that \""their Zoo\"" is worthy of their out-of-reach-for-the-common-man pricing.  Their answer is simply rhetoric, because, when pressed, they won't be able to explain why the price is this high for a family.  \n\nThe bottom line is that, their prices are so incredibly high, that Joe-average, and his family, cannot afford to visit this local zoo without budgeting for it over a couple of months.  Maybe we should've left our fixed-income Grandma and Grandpa at home, although that didn't seem right. \n\n2)  Service:  Everyone we met was attentive and receptive.  They seemed to genuinely want you to have a good time.  \n\n3)  Taste:  Everything we tried was tasty, although it was hard to enjoy because everything is 3 times the price that it should be.  \n\nIn Summation:  I'm not sure why this place is recommended by any kind of governmental body, as to why this is a benefit to the State of Arizona, unless they are making some kind of profit from it.  NO, WAIT, ---- they tax every transaction within the Zoo's control.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSkip this next portion if you're married with kids.  This section is addressed to some Weinee that complained about my comments where I said the $18 entrance fee was too high... \n\n     -----Since you're single, probably going double-dutch, it's no wonder why you'll be shocked by what I've said, because, \""...dude, it's only $18....\"".  That's when everyone else knows that you are alone and have no family responsibilities.  While I might envy your ease-of-movement-as-a-single-guy, please gauge your speculation on the # of your children and the # of your extended family.  For example:  5 kids, plus their total of 11 friends, plus 3 grandparents, for tickets to get in.  Include food/drink while you're there, and I don't even have a big family.  At those rates, I'm sure you'll agree, that this place is monetarily ANTI-FAMILY and prohibitively EXPENSIVE.  No, wait....  LET'S GO EVERY WEEKEND, BECAUSE I'M SINGLE ON A DOUBLE-DUTCH DATE!!!  \n\nWay to go, Commenter Weinee.-----",,,,,,

This is definitely in the top 5 BBQ places we've ever eaten at. Enjoy!",,,,,,

Also shared the Pork Katsu which was a little on the hard side. \n\nThe service was very good considering we had 20 and they were very prompt to ensure your glass was filled.\n\nPrices are average and will not break the bank, ask to see if they have the dinner for 2 for $29.99 which has a appetizer 2 entrees and dessert.\n\nRestaurant is very family friendly and also nice for a quiet dinner for 2",,,,,,
1,Been many times before remodel and liked it Okay. Really good walking material and  a place to enjoy the weather in Phoenix. Post remodel completion I REALLY love coming out here. Nice little touches for the kids and little ones (I have 2 older kids and 2 young toddlers.) They don't overcharge for everything. (Some of the concession stands are high priced)  Lots of great exhibits and everyone in the park is great. Really clean and up to date. Animals seem very well cared for. Been out a dozen times this year and we live a long drive away. Well worth your time.,,,,,,

-1,"Well I'm an Phoenician born AZ native so I've frequented the Phoenix Zoo many, many times throughout my life but after the trip today I don't think I'll be going back. It was so very sad to see so many tired looking, bored out their gourd, animals (they looked elderly) subjected to equally tired old surroundings. Many of the animal facilities were closed barring viewing of the animals at all. Display plaques educating the touring viewer were damaged. Often, audio push-button materials were broken. Staff and caretakers seemed to have no charisma or enthusiasm. Everything and everyone seemed quite jaded. The entire facility seemed to seethe of ways to further separate the visiting guest from the contents of his/her wallet with countless inflationary concession stands, gift shop memorabilia, carnival type rides. They were sickeningly blatant and expensive. The up side? It was a beautiful day with plentiful sunshine and little to no discernable air pollution. From now on I think I'll go to the zoo off Northern Ave. Though I understand it is much more expensive for admission, I just can't justify patronizing the Phoenix Zoo in its current state.",,,,,,
1,"My boyfriend and I recently took our new 11 week old Shih Tzu here to get her 2nd set of shots and we both were kind of nervous. That completely changed once we were greeted by their friendly staff!\n\nThey coo'ed over our puppy and took her in back to show to all of the vet techs and it was so apparent that they care a lot about the pets they see and their owners. Also everyone that came in or left while we were waiting were treated so genuinely, almost like everyone that came in was a close friend.\n\nOnce we entered the exam room they knowledgeably answered all of our questions an then some! They offered advice and when I asked our vet tech if our puppys nails were getting long she said yes, then went into the back and got nail clippers, and while clipping our puppys nails she taught us how to do it for future references!\nWe saw Dr.Johnson and she was wonderful and  she thoroughly explained all of the shots she got that day and the ones she would be getting in the future.\n\nThis place is nothing short of amazing and if you're looking for a new vet  I would go to Foothills Animal Hospital in a heartbeat!",,,,,,
-1,"It's with some regret that I rank the Shadyside Inn Suites so low. We were there for just one night, and overall the accommodations appear quite pleasant. \n\nFor starters, we arrived at the office to check in and the gentleman in the office was on the phone. Although we stood there for at least five minutes while he finished, he never made any attempt to look at us, or indicate that he would be with us as soon as possible. As we waited, several other staff people passed us in the office, and never acknowledged our presence. When he finally got off the phone, he was very pleasant, but never even acknowledged the fact that we had been standing there waiting.  \n\nEven though it was almost 1p, we were told that our room was not yet ready, and that it might not be available until 4p, which was the \""guaranteed check in time.\""  I indicated that we had been on the road for hours and we had an important function that evening, before which we really had hoped to catch a short nap. I asked if he could please get us a clean room as soon as possible, and he said that he could call us when the room was ready. To their credit, they did call us within about 90 minutes.\n\nOur room was essentially a small studio apartment, with a bedroom/sitting room, kitchenette and bathroom.  When we entered we were practically assaulted by an overwhelmingly strong smell of some sort of floor or room cleaner - perhaps an artificial lavender scent - so strong it was like walking into a Bath & Body Works.  Almost immediately my partner developed a bad head ache and we had to leave the door open for about 20 minutes to air it out.  Though the scent diminished a little, it remained strong for the duration of our stay.\n\nThe furniture was modern and the room well laid out.  It included an open wifi network, a rather large flat-screen tv connected to basic cable, a queen sized bed, a large arm chair, and a dining table with chairs. There were a few tacky prints on the walls that appeared to have been designed by some Thomas Kinkaide wannabe.\n \nAs it was January, it was rather cold out, and so we sought to turn up the heat, which was provided via an old radiated steam heat system in the bedroom/sitting area.  There was no wall thermostat, so we had to fiddle around with the knob at the base of the radiator, but as anyone who is familiar with those older steam systems, they're touchy and hard to control. There was also a radiator unit in the bathroom, but it didn't work, which meant it was rather chilly when you stepped out of the shower. The entire evening we found ourselves trying to adjust the heat in the main room, and often opening the window just a crack, to compensate for excess heat, or closing it to allow the heat to build up again. It was bad enough that neither of us got a good night's sleep, because we found ourselves either sweating or shivering, and the temperature never evened out.\n\nI had some work to do while we were there, so after dinner, I sat down to use my computer and the wireless network, but at about 10P, the network shut down, and didn't come back.  I called the main office, only to get a voicemail saying that they were closed; there was an emergency number, but I didn't feel that I wanted to go to that trouble.  I kept checking periodically, but the wifi didn't come back that night.  In fact it wasn't on the next morning when I woke at about 7A.  I called the office again, but the same voicemail was still on, and still again at 7:30A and at 8A.  Finally after I got out of the shower at about 8:30A, the wifi was back.\n\nThe final straw occurred as we were leaving. There was no elevator in the old building, so we had to use the stairwell. Apparently someone had mopped the stairs, but good, shortly before we left our room, and they were slippery and wet, but we were not aware of this, as there was not \""Caution Wet Floor\"" sign, and the stairwell was not illuminated enough to be able to see quite how wet the floor was.  As a result, on the very first step down, my foot slid out from under me, and I landed hard on my backside. Fortunately I wasn't hurt, though I did spend several days with soreness afterward. When I stood up, I realized that the floor had been so wet that in the 2 seconds I was on the floor, my jeans were soaked through to my undies.\n\nWhen we got to the office to check out, the same gentleman who checked us in was attending the desk.  He asked how our stay was, and I limited my comments to my recent fall.  He apologized perfunctorily and made a note, but said nothing else.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, I am sorry to give this low rating, because the place looks like it could be darling. In fact, when we were checking in, we saw they had received an award in 2009 for being Piuttsburgh's \""Most Romantic Getaway\"" spot from the local independent rag.  Nevertheless we experienced too many frustration, and we will not go back if we find ourselves in the Steel City, nor are we comfortable recommending it to anyone else.",,,,,,
-1,"Very upsetting!  Park 51 cafe is under new management.  Some of the new staff not near as friendly.  Norman, who has been there over 20 years is gone.  He was always quick to fill tea and bring out food if the waitresses were busy.  My husband and I started coming here when we were dating.  Now we need to find another breakfast place.",,,,,,
-1,I go to this place a lot for the buffet which is ok. Not really that big of a buffet and if you don't get there when it is fresh you might get some pretty cold food. However this review is about their take-out service. I give them a C- for this experience. They do not give a good portion size to take home and the food was a little bland. I expected more from them. I ordered the pan fried dumpling and the sauce that came with it was very gross it was like they didn't know how to make the proper sauce so they just gave me soy sauce and some spices to go a long with it. It was not good at all. I will probably be going back but only for the buffet would not recommend take out and i will not be doing that again.,,,,,,
1,I love this place and drive about 20 miles just to eat here it has great food and great places. I always get the pollo fundidio and it is delicious every time. I have been going here for about 10 years.,,,,,,
-1,"Beware of this place. We had a mini-dachshund that had a bleeding ulcer. Test after test after test they were still not sure what was wrong with this young 7 year old dog. Ultimately after about $3400 worth of tests they wanted to operate to see if there was something that they were missing. How much? Another $5000. Unfortunately he had already lost too much blood, so surgery was definitely too risky and they knew that. We would up bringing our pup to another vet for a second opinion and the fix was not as invasive or expensive as CVS. Please bring your animal somewhere else! They will make you go broke and play on your feelings. Very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners. To add to this, we have had other friends and family members that have had similar experiences. So yourself and you pet a favor and don't go to these \""specialists\"".",,,,,,

-1,"My husband and I went to Presto on a Tuesday night around 6:30. It was very, very bad. Very bad. So very bad that I'm writing my first Yelp review.\n\nSummary: Some of the food was decent, but everything else is so so very very bad that it's not worth it. I will tell people not to go there and I will never go back.\n\n[The BAD.]\n\nThere was one guy playing hostess/waiter/bartender/bus boy, hitherto referred to as HWBBB. \n\nWe went there specifically to sit on the patio because the weather was awesome, but were told we couldn't because the HWBBB was the only one on staff.\n\nThe temperature in the restaurant was HOT. Stifling. Not normal. 70 outside, 85 inside.\n\nThe menu was schizophrenic. I had no idea what to order. Sushi, pitas, pizzas, steak. Plus a \""build a 3-course meal\"" option. I felt like I was reading the menu at Cheesecake Factory. \n\nThey played dance music? Which is just weird in a restaurant setting.\n\nThey were out of several things. I asked the HWBBB, \""What beers do you have on draft?\"" He said, \""We only have 2. We usually have 4 but we ran out of 2 today.\"" So I'm already disappointed and I don't even know what they have yet. My husband ordered a glass of Malbec and the HWBBB came back and said they didn't have it.\n\nMy order was wrong. I ordered a side salad in lieu of fries. I received an entr\u00e9e salad in addition to my meal, which still came with fries. I ordered a chicken kebob sandwich and received a beef kebob sandwich. We decided things were so bad at this point that I didn't tell the HWBBB of his error. I sucked it up and ate the stupid beef.\n\nThe beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality. Maybe stew meat. I chewed each piece the point I'd realize it wasn't going to break down any further and then spit out what remained. I'm usually not such a disgusting dining companion but this place brought out the best in me. I kept wishing for a normal chewable digestible piece but ended up eventually spitting out every single piece of beef.\n\nWe had a groupon and when the HWBBB brought the bill we got lectured on all the items the groupon did not apply towards. Like alcohol (fine) and the $20 3 course meal my husband ordered, \""because that's already a deal, but I'll make an exception, just this once.\""\n\nWe settled the bill before the dessert from my husband's meal came. Our HWBBB was puzzled that we were still sitting there and eventually asked what else he could do for us. We asked if he could bring the dessert we ordered. \n\nThe apple crisp was like flour and sugar mixed with 3 apple chunks, stuck in the microwave on high for 10 minutes, topped with ice cream.\n\n[The not so bad.]\n\nThe beef tasted good, even if I couldn't chew it.\n\nMy husband's shawarma was good.\n\nThe tzatziki sauce was very good.\n\nThe pita bread was good.\n\nThe salads were ok.\n\nThe curly fries that came with our meals were reminiscent of Jack 'n' the box, one of many other places I dislike but would rather have eaten at.",,,,,,
-1,Pros:\nVegetarian Meatloaf of the Gods (with a yummy peanut gravy)\nLots of cakes/pies\n\nCons:\nSlow and often rude service\nAwful bloody maries (suuper salty) \nOvercooked poached eggs\nIs it just me or is it always cold in there?,,,,,,

-1,"My wife and her family took me here for my birthday, the service was ok we had about 12 people nothing too big. We had two servers both were pretty nice. We ordered food kept it going like a normal service I got the Bar Harbor and it was pretty awesome I got them to add Cajun seasoning into it since I like spicy food. But rather good couldn't complain.\n\nBUT my wife's grandma got a steak and Lobster, she order a medium and it came out well done and her lobster was raw no idea how this happened considering you cook them at two different times but so be it. She sent it back and by the time she got it back we had already ate all our food and had finished desert. I mean what the heck how does it take that long to cook a medium steak? It doesn't! By the time she got her food she wasn't hungry anymore.\n\nSo we get the checks and the server tells me that the manager comped her food since it was messed up and that we wouldn't have to worry about paying for it. Well then they gave her another bill and said that she had to pay for it how the hell that works is beyond me, but she was stuck paying for the damn food that the manager told us we would get credited. \n\nNear the end of the service the servers lacked and kind of vanished and it was just a huge cluster. The quality of this place just tanked and fell low.\n\nThe only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb!!! Everything else is a joke.",,,,,,
1,"The guy behind the counter couldn't have been any nicer when i ordered 10 tons of rock to be delivered. I received a phone call around the time he said I should expect it.

1,"The repair shop does great setups on guitars.  I have had pickups replaced, pickguards,  and many different rewires done here - they are as good or better than anyone in town. PLUS, they carry MESA BOOGIE amps!  I recently bought a Express 5:25 from them - they gave me a great deal - but the service and attention they provide is unmatched.  They ordered a cover for my and called to make sure I recieved it.   I can't tell you how much more pleasant and attentive they are at the Music Store - (100% better than the Guitar Center...)  They have the best selection of sheet music in town also. Give the Music Store your business, you will not be sorry.",,,,,,
-1,"I brought my sick kitty here who was vomitting and had diahhrea for a few days and the Dr we saw was like \""so what do you want to do\"" and I was thinking well thats why I am here to ask for your professional advise. I felt like I spent $100 for absolutely nothing. I would not recommend this clinic for any legit issues, I am sure they are fine for a vaccination or routine check up but I would never allow them to treat one my sick babies. I had taken my lil girl to the AVETS clinic over the holiday and they stabilized her and asked us to F/U with a primary Vet (clearly something significant was going on), the visit I had was a total sham I felt it was useless and I found a new Vet to care for my lil ones.",,,,,,
1,Very good chicken fried steak. Okra. And mashed potatoes. Makes great leftovers if you can't finish!,,,,,,
-1,"I went into Dean of Shadyside salon to get my hair colored. My stylist was nice and friendly however that was not the problem that I encountered at this salon. My stylist rushed through the process of coloring my hair as she had another client during the same time as my appointment. In addition, my hair was just left to hang (not pulled/clipped back) while my hair was being colored making the dark hair dye smear over my ears, neck and face. The worst part was checking out. The charge for the hair color was a decent/normal price around $50.00. However this salon charges you extra if you need more color (if you have thick hair). Are you kidding me? On top on that, they also don't include the blow dry, which yes is more money. Not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service. Won't be back .",,,,,,
1,"I really love this place...there really is no better Hawaiian food in AZ.  I ordered to go.   First,  everyone is so friendly,  The girl at the counter was very good about answering menu questions,  and brought me my take out instead of just yelling my name.   I had the mix plate #1, which mixes 2 battered fish filet and teriyaki chicken.   The chicken is dark meat,  cooked on the flame broiler then sliced and coated with a thick teriyaki sauce.... Yummy! The fish was lightly battered and perfectly deep fried... Moist and tender.   And of course,  you have to order the Potato Mac for your side,  you won't regret it.   I also had a spam roll... Yes,  a sushi style spam roll.   It was only $1.50, but it's certainly not one of the best things I've eaten there,  I just couldn't get into the taste of seaweed and spam together. Oh well,  I had to try it.   Over all,  another great experience.   I can wait to go back on Saturday... I'm craving a laulau plate!",,,,,,
-1,"This place has a decent menu, it's executed pretty well, and they (of course) make their own beers. Too bad it's often packed to the rafters with \""former frat boy turned middling banking executives who still listen to DMB on the side\"". I'm happy to eat there if I happen to be uptown and the crowd wants to... but I try to avoid it whenever I can.",,,,,,
-1,"As the public house cornerstone of the country's dullest downtown, it does not surprise me that Cooper'stown is as inert as a Swiss nationalist.  What is confounding is that the shock-rock nature of the bar's namesake allowed such a gimmicky, flat concept to be executed.  While AC is something of a badass, this pub does not reflect the image of his avante-guard style.  In fact, its just pretty generic.\n\nI couldn't even recommend this as a meeting-for-a-beer-before-the-game spot, as the set-up is awkward when you do not have access to a table or stool (and you likely won't), so while standing up in the bar, you often feel like you are in someone's way -- either the patrons fighting for elbow room to gnaw their sliders or the pitifully eye-made wait staff expediting that woeful fare.\n\nStill, to its credit, Cooper'stown has been a downtown pioneer, and everyone should give the beautiful warehouse building a hearty brick-slap in appreciation of its solidarity as a Phoenician-style Mos Eisley.",,,,,,
1,"I just started working in the central phoenix area, and have to say that Cheese n stuff quickly became my favorite lunch stop around.   They use boar's head meats/cheese on their sandwiches and other quality ingredients in their sides.  The shop is small and quirky, and it's probably best as a carry-out location (they do have some tables inside, and although I've never seen all seats filled, I suppose that's a possibility). \n \nIts reasonably priced, with a gigantic menu and selection.  Their breakfast sandwich is delicious, as is everything I've had for lunch.  In fact, on more than one occasion where I have gone for breakfast and lunch in the same day.\n\nIf you like sandwiches, and miss east coast deli's, this place is for you.",,,,,,
1,Mornings are terrible trying to get in  and out of the parking lots!,,,,,,
-1,I guess their pizza taste great if you're drunk. Slices are so bland and bad. Nothing special here. Overpriced as well. Villa Francesca has much better slices. Check them out instead.,,,,,,
1,"Went here because I knew that it was on Diners, Drive In's and Dives and really enjoyed the family atmosphere and the food.  Getting to hear about the experiences to this place after national televised exposure was absolutely amazing.  The expansion they have had to do and the quality service and food they provided while doing all that is amazing.  I will definitely go back when I get back to the Phoenix area.",,,,,,
-1,"I am so sad to say that my last dining experience at Oregano's was TERRIBLE. The service was 100 percent completely horrendous. I will break it down nice and easy for ya:\n\nThe boy and I took our friend Brittany S. for a birthday lunch.\nBrittany and I were seated, while the boy finished a phone call outside.\nBrittany and I placed our orders. I, a slice of pizza from their lunch menu, and she a house salad with chicken. We informed the server the boy would be in and would also be ordering something.\nThe boy finally arrived and we placed his order - a Bollo Pasta from the lunch menu, and a toasted ravioli appetizer. \nBrittany and I's food arrived first. Mine was fine, or rather, correct (the pizza tasted horrible), while hers was missing the chicken. She called the server over and asked if she could have a side of chicken and he looked at her like it was the most ridiculous request he's ever had. He looked at her strangely for a minute or so, until finally he said \""oh, did you want chicken on that?\"". DUH. \nAt this point, Brittany had gotten up to make a phone call, so Mike and I requested a birthday pizzookie for her. You know, they would embarrass her with the whole singing cheesiness bit. We specifically explain this to the server and he nods his head and asks what kind of pizzookie we want. Great! Or so we thought.\nSo after that Brittany and I slowly eat our food, thinking the boy's would be out at any moment. 10 minutes.. 15 minutes... 20 minutes... 25 minutes passed by and still no food. The joint wasn't busy so we were a little confused. Our server must have noticed our confusion because he came over and asked us if we wanted to order some more food. REALLY?! \""We already ordered his food - 25 minutes ago\"". \""OOOOH, ok, I'll put that in for you\"" was his dumb-ass remark. OK, thanks, bud! \n15 minutes later the rest of the food arrives, and our server says \""oh, now that wasn't too bad!\"" - yeah, except we waited a total of 40 minutes for a goddamned bowl of angel hair with marinara. \n\nSo Mike ate his food and we chatted, when the server came over, gave me a look, and pointed his fingers at me, and said \""oooh, gotcha\"". I'm assuming he forgot about our pizzookie as well, and quickly remembered upon the \""I'm going to kill you\"" look I gave him. \n\n10 minutes later we see him coming with the pizzookie. Here we are, expecting some big embarrassing birthday song (because they DO do birthdays at Oregano's), and all he does is set the cookie down on the table, looks at Brittany, and says \""so, it's your birthday?\"", then awkwardly looks at Mike and I like we are supposed to know what to do. WHAT?! NO BIRTHDAY SONG?! He smiles awkwardly and walks away. \n\nBy this point Mike and I are so furious that we are ready to stand up and scream in this guys face. We eat the cookie and he brings us our bill. Hell no did he charge us for EVERY single little thing he forgot. He also didn't give us the lunch special prices (we ordered before the cut off) Come on, we weren't expecting you to comp our entire bill, but seriously. Don't charge us the $2.50 for the chicken you forgot, or the two dishes you forgot, or the birthday cookie that you totally screwed up and still had the nerve to ring in as \""birthday\"" and charge us for it, or overcharge us for the lunch plates. SERIOUSLY?! \n\nWe threw down and left. Pissed. Pissed that our server forgot every single thing we ordered. Pissed that we spent almost two hours on lunch because of it. And pissed that he didn't even once acknowledge our frustrations. I won't be coming back here again. At least not during lunch when this idiot's around.",,,,,,
-1,Unbelievably rude service. The nice gentleman at the front who told us to sit anywhere was the only pleasant portion of this visit. It took the waitress 5 minutes to even bring us menus another 3 to get water. The waitress came over rudley asked if we were ready. I asked for a beer list she snapped at me that they dont have one. I asked what they had she snarled just tell me what you want. I think my disgusted look indicated I was not going to guess what they keep in their bar.  She finally snapped at me what my options were I ordered and we skipped dinner as I couldn't stomach being treated poorly an entire meal. My 2 minute interaction was enough.,,,,,,
-1,"No vegetarian options, and staff always too busy and not personable.",,,,,,
-1,"I have eaten here many times but I wasn't so impressed when I ate there for lunch the other day.  I guess the thing to remember about this place is to get there early.  If you don't, you will be waiting for food and nan.  My wife and I got there at 12:30 and every container was at the bottom or empty.  Asked the lady what was up and she said that everyone came in at once. Uhm, yeah, it is called a lunch rush.  Really pissed me off that she said that.  Waited for food and waited even longer for the nan.  Even though the service was really lacking this day, I will be back because the food is good.",,,,,,

The pre dinner cocktails were a perfect start. My wife had the Pure Bliss and I had the Spritz. I felt like I was back in Italy sipping on this refreshing aperitif! Marcellino's home made fresh pasta was nothing short of outstanding. My wife had the Strachetti w truffles and sausage and I had the tortoloni stuffed w filet. Ridiculously good. The home made Tartufo accompanied w an espresso martini was the perfect ending to a perfect night. Our servers Daniel and Mike were excellent as were our bus boys who were pleasant and attentive. Expect to pay but originally being from NYC we are used to these prices. I never mind paying when you have such an amazing date night experience! Grazie mille Marcellino!  We will definitely be back.",,,,,,

1,I popped into Grinders yesterday afternoon (a bit after lunch time) for a pick-me-up.  I just love this neighborhood gem.  There's a nice comfy vibe and the staff is welcoming and accomodating.  They patiently fielded my questions about available sugar-free syrup options and happily indulged my request for a combination of syrups for my iced latte.  It was fantastic!\n\nI've recently been informed that they host blues music on the 2nd Saturday evening of each month.  I can't wait to check it out next month.,,,,,,
1,I am a full time traveler and have difficulty finding a good nail salon. This one fit the bill nicely. I soent 5 months in the area and went every 3 weeks for colored acrylic.Ask for Danny.

They easily would last longer but I tired of the color so we changed it every 3 weeks. \nI recommend this salon for nail but I cannot speak to pedicures although they are very busy.,,,,,,
1,You just can't go wrong with the original fish taco. We also had a shrimp taco which was absolutely delicious. They seemed a little short staffed but soon after we were served a man came in to pick up 3 large carryout totes; must have been why we waited a little longer than normal.

-1,"I mean...seriously? \nI should have known better given that it only had one positive review. My 600th yelp review, you think I'd've learned by now!\nI wandered in here looking for a pedicure. My first hint should have been the old crusty polishes on the walls - no Essie etc here. But whatever, I picked out my color and headed to the dilapidated pedicure chair. (I put my bag on the adjacent tray and it couldn't support the weight). They don't use razors here, which is fine, but I expected a thorough scrubbing of my callouses, and when she gave me a tiny little once over then unceremoniously threw my feet back into the water I thought to myself, OK there's no way on earth this is more than a $10 pedicure right? My heels still looked as bad as they did when I walked in. \nThen she painted my nails and sat me down at the \""dryer\"" which consisted of two tiny fans pointed at my feet. For real. I had to sit there for over ten minutes, she proclaimed my toes dry, then I paid - $25?!!!! For $25 in Boston where I'm from I could get a legit pedicure. I was dumbfounded. I paid, walked home, and lo and behold two of my toes already had smudged polish. ARGH!",,,,,,
-1,"Tried this because it's local.  Terrible, bland Chinese food.  Not much else to say.  Will never return.

As promised, we looked hard into the sauce and found one very small piece of pineapple.  Bon Appetite.",,,,,,

After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. \n\nI don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said \""dish looks beautiful.\"" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  \n\nThe table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \""I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\"" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!\nAt this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \""it's not my job to make people happy\"" that's strange considering he wants our business. \nSo the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.\n\nI couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.",,,,,,
-1,"I have never had such awful, inedible food at such an appallingly ridiculous price. It's not only a failure in execution, the plates are very poorly put together, and the flavors of the sides and sauces with the protein do not marry well at all. I was severely disappointed by plating, and then just got mad when I started eating.\nYou would think for 44$ your steak would at least be properly cooked. What was supposed to be medium, came raw. The steak was tough and tasteless. \nAhi tuna, asked rare, was overcooked; also bland, even with the sauce. The oshinko side was laughable. Seriously. I laughed. \n\n pasta was overcooked, and by the time it got to us, the sauce was laminated with coagulating fat. \nThe sushi was an amatuer attempt at best.  There was too much rice, and presentation was sad. \nAmbience is tacky. Ugly 80s-reminiscent wallpaper covers half the room and framed sketches of fish plaster the other half.\nService was the only redeeming quality. \nTo put it in perspective, my neighborhood Houlihans seems gourmet next to this place.",,,,,,
1,"I was out in Phoenix in October. My Dad had mentioned seeing the Triple D show on Los Toquitos and said I might want to try it when I was there. A few friends in Phoenix said the same. We finally made it there on our last day in town. Glad we went there after the lunch rush because the dining room is pretty small. There was outside seating available though. \n\nThe food was really good, I had the Carne Asada tacos, my son had the fish tacos. Both were excellent but the real surprise was how good the refried beans where. Usually the rice and beans are an afterthought and not much effort goes into them. The green sauce on the table was terrific too. I will definitely be back next time I am in the Phoenix area.",,,,,,
-1,"This place is the worst. \nOf course, it's beautiful and has a great selection of books...so long as you don't mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to live. \nEvery time I walk into this library, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells wondering what rule I might break next. And God forbid they catch your child with a Goldfish cracker in the kids section...off with their heads! \nAdditionally, once it was off limits to Savoy/Mahomet residents, I felt unwelcome there and totally uncomfortable. \nI do have a grad student friend who had her feet slightly outside her sandals and got yelled at for it. Who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes? \nAnd the children's librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids, but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there. I thought that was the point of a library? To excite people about reading and give FREE ACCESS TO ALL. \nChampaign \""Public\"" library (which it really isn't anymore) is truly the most unfriendly library I have ever been to and I will never go back there again.",,,,,,
-1,"I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.\n\nCoincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?\n\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  \n\nSo no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.\n\nFortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all.",,,,,,
-1,"After eating at Bistro 19 I was very excited when I saw that Il Pizzaiolo was right next door.  I had thought about eating here in the past but was always put off by the location.  That being said, I went to Il Pizzaiolo last night with my fiance, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  We started with the Caesar salad, which was OK.  The dressing was delicious, however there was very little of it, and we found ourselves eating entire bites of dry, flavorless lettuce.  It was also an outrageous $10 dollars.  Don't get me wrong, had this been an entree sized portion, $10 would have been more than appropriate.  However it was just a starter size, and should have been no more than $6.\n\nWe then shared their margherita pizza which had delicious flavors, but was incredibly soggy.  It was also fairly small, but that was almost to be expected.  It was $12 dollars, so the size was not necessarily a problem, however it was hard to enjoy such a soggy mess of a pizza.  We also shared a pasta dish which was INCREDIBLY overpriced.  At $17 dollars, I was expecting more than a small bowl filled with dry pasta.  It was homemade, and well made, however it was almost insultingly small.  We finished with tiramisu which was excellent, and appropriately priced at $8.\n\nIn all, I found the flavors of their food to be excellent, however i was horribly misled.  Not only was every menu I found online roughly $2 to $3 dollars cheaper than their actual menu, but there was a table next to us who ordered pasta and received an enormous portion, prompting us to order pasta.  It was only till later did we realize that they were employees who had decided to dine their for the evening.  We also had a serious problem with the timing of the food.  The service was great, however for a Tuesday night, I would have thought their kitchen could time the courses properly; we had barely started our salad when the entree's came.  In all, I don't think I will be going back to this restaurant, nor would I recommend anyone waste their time traveling out to Mt. Lebanon for average Italian.",,,,,,
-1,"I wish there were zero stars. I had TWC for several years and they were always a pain. Internet service was shoddy, they throttle speed,  they bully you into cable subscriptions to keep themselves relevant, and they just gave us a $125 unreturned equipment fee for equipment that I did in fact return. They have odd hours,  and if you move you have to physically bring the box to their office. And guess what?  No after hours drop box,  so your only option is to take time out of your work day. AT&T is much better. Avoid TWC like the plague. They'll never stop nickel and diming you.",,,,,,
1,I have been to this noodle cafe many times and love love their Ramen. Their TanTanMen is very good and very hot. I like their Shrimp Shumai too.  The sushi is OK but I don't go there for that.,,,,,,
-1,EXTREMELY upset with the pharmacist Nicole.  Went and dropped off my perception tonight and she told me that I just filled it on Friday at another Walgreens. She was telling me that I can not double fill medicine. She didn't ecen wait for me to get to the counter she was sharing my business with everyone waiting for the tske care clinic. She just kept saying I can not fill pain medicine twice.  I called the other wslgreens I supposly filled at they said that was a perception from LAST year 2012 and that it clearly states 2012! She is very unprofessional and has NO customer service skills. Everyone waiting heard and was starring at me I  am sure thinking I was trying to fill the same perception!  I will never step foot into this store again. I suggest you don't either if you want to be treated with respect and not feel your some kind of scam artist! Bad thing os the other people are nice and friendly!,,,,,,
-1,"Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Very average.... The food seemed similar to Del Taco, but on a real plate. The Fajitas was a joke....This place looks run down & old, which scares me a little bit to eat here. Canyon Cafe/Sam's Mexican Cafe at Arizona Center downtown....NOW we're talkin'!  ...Waaaaay better!",,,,,,
1,"Exactly as expected. I had the country fried steak and I was full within ten bites. Must have been having one of those mornings. \n\nNot really my thing, but a great experience and a really cool place. I will admit that I ate all the leftovers the same night, and it was still pretty damn good.\n\nGuess Mama didn't make that much Chicken Fried Steak growing up.",,,,,,
-1,"I am confused. I am baffled. I am in shock. I am disappointed.  \nWhen I read the reviews I was a little surprised but I figured somehow I must have looked over this place after all these years and I was actually regretting it!  Now...not so much. I quickly realized there was a reason I grew up right around the corner yet never visited this place.  I realized there was a reason I never even stepped foot in this place on a lunch break while working at the neighboring Food Lion as a squeaky teenager with braces. Back then I thought Ragu was gourmet so I wasn't even picky but STILL knew to stay away from Juliana's  There is a reason why our Italian family of 7 never bothered ordering from here even though it was cheap and close by!  You have to realize this was before the restaurant scene really even popped off in Charlotte!! There were no options!  Uptown was downtown, the arboretum was for the wealthy and Ballantyne didn't exist.  But still....Juliana's was never an option....now I see WHY!!\n\nWe opened the door and immediately fell back into 1973.  The diner feel of this place gave me the creeps and the whole restaurant turned to stare as we entered.  It was awkwardly quiet and just didn't have a comfortable feel AT ALL.  I wanted to leave from the moment I stepped in but I figured I needed to get over myself and give it a try.  Sometimes the best food comes out of little hole in the wall restaurants.  I wasn't expecting much but I realize decor is not the only thing that matters.\n\nWe decided to stick with the absolute basic.  I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parm 12 inch sub.  My husband isn't as picky as I am so I was counting on him to enjoy this sub.  It is pretty hard to mess up a chicken parm sub.\n\nMy pasta came out and all I can tell you is that the sauce was brown.  It looked like gravy.  When I mixed it in with the spaghetti it somehow just vanished so it was basically like eating noodles with a hint of brown gravy.  It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I took one bite of the meatball and thought I was going to throw up.  It was atrocious.  It was spongey and tasted like deer meat.  It was so gross.  My husband's chicken parm sub had the same doo-doo brown gravy on it and the chicken was like rubber.  Literally.  He could hardly bite through it.  When he said he couldn't eat this sub, I KNEW it was bad.  He eats anything.  I for darn sure wasn't eating my dish so we just sat their staring at each other.  I forgot to mention the salad and texas toast that was served with the meal...the salad was frozen iceburg with nothing else and the toast was a piece of lilly white bread with some butter and garlic slapped on it.  BLLLLEH!!!!\n\nEventually the waitress made her way over to us and we weren't sure what to say but I can tell you I have only not been able to eat a meal due to COMPLETE dissatisfaction twice in my whole life.  The waitress noticed that we didn't eat our meals and asked if we wanted a box to go.  Um, WOW.  No, we want to just get out of here.  We asked for our check and told her we weren't really satisfied but that we didn't want to make a big deal, no need for managers, etc.  Well, one of the \""managers\"" (son to the woman who owns and cooks) came over.  He offered us anything else off the menu to replace our meals.  We didn't want anything else from this dump.  We wanted to just LEAVE and go eat.  We were starving and on a time crunch.  \n\nLong story short--They made us pay for the meal that we didn't even touch.  The owner came out and was extremely nasty.  She said she posted that they do not refund for food.  She then pointed to this itty bitty note on her cash register.  She said she can't please everyone's taste buds so she is not going to refund anyone.  What?  So does this happen often enough that you have to have a disclaimer on your food?  That is TERRIBLE servie for a small mom and pop, or just mom shop.  It was like they were used to people not liking their food so they were prepared to argue their point.  IT was bizarre.  I don't understand that concept.  They said you can order a pizza or something else so they are still losing money by having to make a whole other meal!  Either way, it was their approach and the fact that the food was absolutely disgusting.  I would NEVER want to support this place, local or not.\n\nI asked them where they were from because no one that was born and raised in Italy would have created the mess that they did.  They were actually greek.  I suppose they just have a different way of preparing Italian food because it was NOT authentic.\n\nI looked back at those who offered such stellar reviews and realized that most of the people were from random towns/areas.  Maybe they haven't been exposed to the real deal in terms of Italian food so somehow this place was okay to them.  Not me.  I'm telling you...If you love Italian food and have had real authentic Italian food...DO NOT GO HERE.  End of story",,,,,,
-1,"Had dinner at Lemon Grass earlier this week. When I walked in the place was empty. Got to pick where I wanted to sit. First thing I noticed is the place was an absolute sauna. I asked my server about why it was so hot in the restaurant? She shrugged and did not seem interested.\n\nI ordered the Lemon Grass soup with shrimp and the Papaya salad. I used the terms \""Tom Yum\"" and \""Som Tum\"" when I ordered. These terms are not used in their menu - I was under the impression they were fairly standard terms for these Thai menu items. In any case - she had no clue to what I was referring to - so I used their terms.\n\nSoup came out immediately - soup was not very spicy or lemon grassy - which is ironic given the name of this place. There was a lot more tomato chunks in their version of this soup than I've experienced before. I would not order this again.\n\nThen the Papaya salad came out - just ok - not spicy and bright like a good Papaya salad should be.\n\nWater glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty.\n\nWon't come back here again unless they do something about the lack of AC and better food!",,,,,,
1,"Took my family here for dinner on a Tuesday night. The experience far exceeded all expectations.\n\nOur server was very fast and attentive to our needs.\n\nThe food was incredible! All of us young and old loved our dishes.\n\nThe interior is very relaxing and there's a perfect blend in the atmosphere here between romantic and family dining. I had two little children with me and they felt at home, but I could easily see myself coming back with just my wife for a romantic night out.\n\nOverall one the best restaurants in Ahwatukee that I've visited. Thanks!",,,,,,
1,"Years ago I quit going to dominos due to poor quality and lousy service... This location has made me a customer again. The food is so good , and the delivery so quick, I can't believe it's the same place.",,,,,,
-1,"Some of the rides here are quite carnival-ish. However, there are some good ones like \""The Borg\"". The food sucks and is WAY overpriced as is the souvenirs. The park constantly smells like garbage and on a hot summer day when you've been waiting in line for a good hour it's not a pleasant experience to bask in the stench of garbage mingled with the patrons sweat. I would probably tolerate this park much better if I didn't have to smell that. \nIt's great for kids if you don't mind spending all of your time surrounded by other's crying/screaming kids in kiddy-land or in the over-rated water park. Speaking of the water park - why is inevitable that when you finally get up to the top of the slide something breaks? This park always has something breaking mid-ride. There have been tales of people stuck on top of the Drop Zone for hours- not sure how true that is.",,,,,,
-1,"I stopped in here today for lunch since I was in the area. The service was friendly and nice. I ordered the carne asada tacos. First I got chips and went to the salsa bar. The chips were noticeably stale, but the salsa was good. The carne asada tacos were gross. The meat tasted spoiled, the texture was weird and it was greasy. I was very hungry but could only stomach two bites. The beans were runny and tasted bad. I will not be back here again.",,,,,,
1,"It's a pizzeria. Oh wait, it's a market. Oh wait, it's also a gelateria! I don't know what the hell it is, but I sure like it! We stopped here for a late lunch and I was blown away by the choices. I finally decided on a turkey sandwich, and I definitely made the right choice.  The turkey and avocado on top of the turkey was some of the freshest I've had in a while! My only complaint was that they were out of multi grain bread, but the wheat bread I substituted was very good. And my incredible sandwich came with a side fruit cup...best strawberries ever! Why can't we get this good of fruit in Chicago? Sigh....\n\nBy day you can help yourself at the counter at La Grande Orange Grocery, but at night the pizzeria does wait on tables.  Yes, they do it all and next time I'll definitely be trying those incredible looking baked goods and perhaps even a pizza.",,,,,,
1,"Usually I cut my own wood, but middle of last winter I found myself in a pinch running out of wood and having no time to cut more.\n\nWent to Berry Bros and purchased a cord of mesquite.  Apparently they get it from Hyder AZ.  It's good, dry mesquite and has burned well, and I still have some leftover for this winter.\n\nMany of the pieces are very large, and since it's mesquite, you would need a VERY big fire to get some of these pieces to burn.  I used my axe (and even my maul a couple times) to split the pieces into smaller burnable ones.  My only gripe would be that most of the pieces of their mesquite are not cut at even angles on the ends, so they will not stand up on their own when you set them down vertically to split.  I needed to use a wedge the majority of the time so the logs would stand up on their own\n\nAgain this is a small gripe, but for what I spent I would like the wood to have even 90 degree angles on each side to facilitate easier splitting.\n\nI will be back again if I find myself running out of wood this winter.",,,,,,
1,My sister and I went here and it was great. She had the crab stack and I had the lucious fish tacos.I went back again and my husband had the fish and chips and I had the halibut special. Again just wonderful. Place is pretty and service was friendly. Plus they have valet parking!,,,,,,

-1,"The interior decor is nicer than the strip mall suggests. This seems to be true in Arizona a lot. The special that evening was Cajun shrimp with Anchovy Sauce, but I wasn't in the mood for those flavors as I was eating a bit early. This was to be a light meal.\n\nI ordered the clams in broth. 20 clams in a nice bowl, but the broth was very heavy on black pepper. I would have preferred, buttery or white wine or other flavors, but there were only green scallions to fight for dominance. The clams were ok, but some were gritty. I ordered a spicy salmon roll and that was very good. I liked the roe on the outside of the roll and the roll stayed intact as I brought it to my mouth. My partner got the Ahi with glaze and it was prepared perfectly, although the glaze was heavy handed. The tea was nice. My Raspberry Spritzer had a flavor I couldn't determine and I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I actually added water to it, to soften the flavor and that's not something I've done often anywhere. The dessert case didn't have all the selections, but from my partners perspective the cheesecake looked nice, but when it was delivered it looked like the flan selection. oops. That tall white thing we saw was a vanilla cake, not the cheesecake. The actual cheesecake was shrunken and covered with a light brown sauce. I tolerated only one bite, it was dry, it was old and it was sour tasting, and we just left it on the table. Yuck. \n\nDespite the 2 stars this visit we will likely return. I think there are better things on the menu and more things to try.  I won't bother with desserts of fancy drinks next time.",,,,,,
-1,Stay away!! I had a guy who lived in the complex try to break into my apartment 3 times! I literally caught him twice at my side window trying to break in. I called the cops and our neighbors who also called the cops when they caught the guy red handed as well. I had 3 police reports. The manager would not  move us to another apartment even after 3 attempted break ins. My daughter and fianc\u00e9e did not feel safe there alone while I worked nights so we gave our 30 day notice and moved out. I did not receive any of the court notices after I moved out so obviously did not attend court and automatically lost. I got a hold of the actual owner of the complex and explained the situation and even offered to settle but he didn't care at all and said it was already to collections. I got garnished for about 5 months until i quit my job because i couldnt live off of the pay after the garnishment. Now I have $5000 on my credit,,,,,,
-1,"Talk about sucking the fun out of what, by nature, should be nothing but rainbows and sunshine and unicorns.\n\nThe staffer working here on our visit was so sour and unwelcoming that husband and I turned right around and walked out.  Too bad, too, because the place looked adorable and was packed wall-to-wall with unique confections of the chocolate persuasion.\n\nEven the pedagogical Oompa Loompas loosened up and danced every now and again.",,,,,,
-1,"OK- this review has been a long time coming.  I have visited Luna four times now and each time is worse than before.  First off, the service is always slow and they seem to consistently be out of specials.  I have gone for lunch multiple times and it always averages two hours b.c. the service is soooo slow.  \n\nNow, onto my dinner last night.  I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine- which promptly came in a dirty glass complete with a lip imprint!  The waitress apologized and then announced she was the only server in the whole restaurant and the place was full!  She also mentioned that they started their new menu last night and she had no idea what was on it.  Classy. \n\nI ordered the lobster ravioli and after 10 minutes, she returned and said \""I don't know why this is the special.  The chef is searching for the pasta.\""  No thank you.  I changed my order to the chicken dijonaise.  It came out looking decent until I took a bite.  There was so much salt on it, I couldn't eat it.  \n\nThis place is so overrated it's not even funny.  I wouldn't be surprised if they closed down soon and honestly hope they do.  The service is awful, food is less than mediocre, and it's overpriced.",,,,,,
1,"I have been to several Streets of New York locations around the valley and haven't had a bad experience at any of them,  and this one was no different.  They have one of the best cold roast beef sandwiches, they are super liberal with the portion of meat and the bread is always very fresh. The wings are meaty enough to order as an entree themselves or great to share. Once you are finished with all of the food you can order up some cheesecake for dessert! Overall this is my go to place when people are looking for a variety of food that all tastes good but still friendly on the wallet.",,,,,,
-1,"The summary is that I could have been better served and diagnosed by a blind monkey than I was by Dr. Lawrence Kramer and his staff.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I'm not normally one to be negative.  But I have never left a place of business feeling more disgusted, useless, and violated than I did today.  \n\nMy experience: I made an appointment at 11:15.  Showed up at 11:15.  Didn't get in until 12:00.  Then, my appointment with Dr. Lawrence Kramer was shorter than the time the nurse took to measure and weigh me. Dr. Lawrence Kramer cares only about getting you out as soon as you come in to make more $$$$ by seeing more patients.  \n\nAnd patient beware: he'll try to get you to buy more stuff in the short amount of time he'll spend with you.  First he tried to force a chest exam on me...then it was a flu shot.  And I'm supposed to trust this guy?  He doesn't even try to diagnose the problem, and then wants more $$$ by prescribing stuff that is totally unrealated to the reason why I'm there.  \n\nAfter my experience with Dr. Lawrence Kramer, I went outside and ran into one of the workers in the building.  I told her about my experience, and she asked about the doctor.  I said, 'I went to see Dr. Lawrence Kramer.'   She said, 'Go figure.  That doctor is the worst.  He only cares about the signing off on tickets.'\n\nEnough said.  Take your kids, your health problems, and your medical insurance far away from Dr. Kramer at the Biltmore Medical Center on Highland.  Hopefully the lull in his practice forces him to reevaluate how he treats his patients.",,,,,,

1,"Always very busy, and a 35 min drive for me to get here since I live in gilbert but really, I dont even care. Everything about this place it so worth it. The important part though is, their coffee! Best coffee I have ever had ever. They have a yummy breakfast menu, everything I have every ordered is yummy, including their crepes! Lunch is good, and have to try their pizza!! I always saw a couple of Phoenix sun's players there, which is nice also since I am a suns fan.",,,,,,
-1,"You may end up here on Sat night if all the other area bars are busy.\n\nI'm not going to come down too hard on this place because it wasn't my choice to come here. One of the locals led a group of guys here initially just to have 'one shot'. He lives in the Avenue and knows the bar owner and several of the staff.  We got quick and efficient service at a great price\nand ended up staying for a few rounds of beers after a round of shots.\n\nThis place is rough, watch your back, There is a lot of drama and the kind of place where testosterone mixed with alcohol can make for a volatile mix.",,,,,,
-1,"I've been here twice. Both times, I pulled up and sat waiting at the entrance, and some guy from the shop next door had to run over and notify someone of my presence. The second time I was actually backing out of the driveway to leave and the guy chased me down. \n\nIf you ask to have your wheels cleaned, the attendants use brushes on them. These same brushes are used on the exterior of your car. Car nuts have an adage of \""don't use on your wheels what you use on your paint\"" but we can forgo that for this review. My gripe here is that I ended up with scratches on my wheels. My car isn't anything to write home about so I'm not particularly worried about scratches in my paint, but if you have a newer/nicer car, I would look out for this. \n\nOne thing I like about this place (and a star redeemer) is that your car is hand dried at the end. Going along with that extra star is the fact that the people here are nice and aren't trying to screw you over; the quality of the wash could be better though. \n\nGo here, get the cheap wash, leave with a clean and dry car.",,,,,,
-1,"I am a big fan of the Whole Foods company in general.  The store back home (Omaha) had a wine bar, espresso bar, gelato, sushi and udon stand, a GIANT cheese counter where you could sample...I could go on.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Whole Foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  Two-thirds of the time they are out of what I came for.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying THAT much for groceries, I want a stellar shopping experience.  This WF is mediocre at best.",,,,,,
-1,"I cannot for the life of me figure out why I keep coming back to Yong's. I have NEVER arrived on the day and time my items are supposed to be done and been able to pick them up. Always an apology and a request to come back tomorrow. About half the time they screw up the work, doing careless things like sewing on patches way off center and crooked, misspelling embroidery, or forgetting portions of work. They also take FOREVER! I recently dropped off a single pair of pants that needed a hem repair on one leg where the original thread had snagged and come out. They said it would be a week.  We are talking about 90 seconds worth of work to those who are skilled at such things, so it shouldn't really take that long, but whatever.  Then I go pick them up, and they have not lined up the hem correctly so it is a bubbly break instead of a crisp one.  They also unhemmed and rehemmed the other leg that had been fine when I brought the pants in, but is now bubbly as well.  The pants do not look good and I am looking for another place to have them fixed.\n\nI think there are some major organization issues here, as the place is always a disaster and I think the reason they don't get things done is because they can't keep track of it all. Still, as inept as they are, everyone working here is extremely friendly and they are sincerely apologetic when something goes wrong.",,,,,,
1,"Just moved here from Kansas City and my Infiniti was driven the whole way. Needless to say it was covered with KS, TX, and OK bugs.

Only advice would be to plan on it taking a little longer because it is a true hand wash. \n\nWill be going back!!!",,,,,,

1,"As far as wine and cheese bars go - this place has Postino's beat by a long shot.  The wine list is impressive.  The staff can make recommendations on the fly.  The owner actually takes his staff to visit vinyards so they become familiar with the wines.  The food is out of this world - but unpretentious.   You don't have to travel to Scottsdale to get fine food and drink -- we've got it right here in Central Phoenix at Cheuvront.   With that said - try the Macaroni and Cheese - which is what I tried tonight - out of this world, albeit a little spicy.  I've eaten there three times and have yet to try a desert because I'm so stuffed from the fabulous cheese selection and wine.  My new favorite!",,,,,,

1,"I visited this place when I was on a business trip to Phoenix. My colleague and me walked out our office on a moderately warm day and were looking to grab a bite to eat.\n\nWe wandered across the street from the office into the Biltmore Mall (supposedly an upscale mall) but could not find anything to our liking.\n\nWe looked across the street and saw The Capital Grill and decided to venture into it. It is a very nice restaurant and is very tastefully decorated. Was not sure of the food when we sat down to order.\n\nI looked at the Menu and decided to have the \""Lobster & Crab Burger\"". Also ordered hand made fries with it (what the heck). If the lobster and crab were not going to clog my arteries, I was sure that the fries would do the trick!!\n\nWas a little skeptical but my colleague also ordered the same. We looked a each other and thought that at $19 a pop for a burger it better be good.\n\nFirst the fries came. Not sure if it was the hunger that was clouding the judgement but the fries were presented very nicely and were cut thin and crispy as I like it. So far so good.\n\nThe the well dressed butler (yes) served the burger with a bow and whispered \"" Enjoy you meal sir\"" lightly into my ears. \n\nThe burger was open faced with one half of the burger bread outside and the other half had this nice looking chunk of lobster and crab cake blended with Old Bay seasoning with a side of freshly prepared tartar sauce. \n\nI tell you this was the best tasting crab & lobster cake I have ever had. It just melted in my mouth and I kind of licked the plate dry. It was the highlight of my day after half a day of meetings (well I need to 'fess that the other highlight was the ICC World Cup Match that I watched from 2:00 AM  - 9:00 AM).\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this place. I am definitely coming back here on my next business trip.",,,,,,
-1,"Their claim of so tender that you don't need teeth to eat it is wrong...that pulled pork was tough n dry...the BBQ sauce was hot, mildly spicy but not sweet or thick...good size servings, the sides of coleslaw n Mac n cheese were good but the meat left something to be desired...if you ever go to lock harts in tax, you'd say the same thing ....oh and the ladies room need to be renovated..",,,,,,
-1,"I have to give Pedro's a \""good news, bad news\"" review.  I tried the Camarones wrap -  big mistake.  The shrimp were barely warm and slimy.  The rest of the filling in the wrap was also unappetizing; shredded lettuce and maybe some tomatoes in a disgusting creamy sauce.  After 2 bites I had to give up, I couldn't choke down any more.\n\nI give the waiter credit though.  When I complained he offered to bring me something else or take if off the bill with no argument.  My party ordered the \""table\"" Guacamole, a 2 avocado version mixed to your preference at the table.  That was very good. \n\nSo try the table guac, but give the shrimp wrap a pass.  The waiter was also truly nice.  So like I say, good news, bad news.",,,,,,
-1,"I'm rating this of my initial experience with this place and my disappointment. I had been wanting to check out this place as I had been hearing great things about the wine and cheese selections plus I drive by  there everyday. \n\nMy friend and I chose to check it out on a mellow weekday afternoon and we did not even eat/drink here because of the initial impression we received. We walked into the front entry and saw there was only one couple at a table and it was slow due to the time of day. We looked around and eventually expected to see anyone who worked there as we awkwardly waited near the hostess stand for several minutes. Finally, a server emerged who did not even acknowledge us in any way and went to help the one table. After that it appeared that a cook or someone from back of house came out to the bar and again did not acknowledge us either. Finally, a couple minutes later the waiter came out into the dining room again and we asked to see a wine list just to get his attention. He then made his way over to hand us a wine list. At that point, we were pretty much over this place as we did not want to see how much worse the service might get if we actually stayed. I was really disappointed that the experience was so bad without even trying the place as I was really looking forward to finding a new downtown restaurant.",,,,,,
1,"I went with the suggestions of Yelpers and stopped in to Coach and Willie's for drinks pre- Dbacks game.  It was a good choice, I think.  I didn't care for the outside which has loud music playing but inside it's a nice pub (upscale is a bit of a stretch...) with lots of TVs tuned to sports.  We were able to snag two seats at the bar and even ordered some nachos.  \n\nA few thoughts:\n\nStanding room is kind of scarce.  If it ever got really packed you would have to stand around people at tables eating and while I don't really care I know that its something my husband doesn't like to do.  \n\nIt took forever to get the bartenders to notice us and take our orders.  And we were sitting at the bar!  When our nachos came they were asking for the \""S.\"" party and we were flailing our arms in front of the bartender and screaming \""that's us!\"" and she still didn't see us!\n\nThe bartenders were pretty cool.  They made some futile attempts to get a \""Let's Go Dbacks\"" chant going but the crowd wasn't that into it.  (And at that point there weren't that many Cubs fans there...)  They had a good healthy banter with the Cubs fans which was amusing.   They didn't care when we ordered shots of Jager, although the two female Cubs fans next to us were shocked.  (Sorry, this is just how we roll.  We don't take shots of whatever that nuts and berries concoction that you're drinking is....)  \n\nThe nachos were strange.  The chicken was like grade F chicken and there was a lot of the fixings but they were not well layered at all.   There was a ton of stuff on top (including all the guac and sour cream) then a bunch of naked chips and then a whole ton of cheese and all the beans on the bottom.  We also asked for jalapenos on the side, but they just didn't give them to us at all.\n\nI would definitely go back here before a game again.  It was a good relaxed atmosphere and a quick walk over to the stadium.  However, I think I'll probably stick with drinking there and save my munchies for the ballpark.",,,,,,
1,"This place always smells so good walking by! Bath & Body Works is my go to gift spot when I don't know what to get someone. By someone I mean a woman, what girl doesn't love yummy scented bath products? They are a bit pricey, but usually have good deals where you can stock up, especially around the holidays. My fav items are the lil hand sanitizers, lil hand lotions (both good for my purse), candles & their hand soaps that look great in my kitchen. They have the best scents too, with warm vanilla sugar, vanilla noel (holiday special), coconut lime & country apple being some of my favs. I've been going here since HS, so I'm sure I'll be going here till I'm an old lady!",,,,,,

-1,"Okay, so I was completely prepared for the worst when I got here, since the average review for this place was about 2 stars.\n\nMy flight landed in the morning, and I called to see if checking in early would be an option. It wasn't. I should have a shot around 1:30pm, though.  Okay, cool..I'll find something to do for 4 hours. So I drop in at 2:30pm--surely they have ONE clean non-smoking room ready, right??\n \nNo....they don't. I'm a little annoyed at this point, but the girl behind the desk can't really do anything about it, so I walk back to my car and sleep for an hour....then finally, success. There's a $20(?) deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week. We'll see. If you've read my other reviews, I NEVER have great luck with these \""deposits.\""\n\nAbout the room:\n-It's not new. But it's not old, either. \n-There's a tube tv circa 1999, no fridge OR microwave OR coffee machine. Those things you'll have to specifically request (for a fee!). \n-The walls? Terribly, terribly thin. I'm nervous about going to sleep tonight....and waking up in the morning.\n-Couple of hairs floating around the room. The bed, the lamp shade...and the shower wall was COVERED in them. Speaking of the bathroom...\n-Not cleaned. At all. Somebody's draws were on the door (I took a pic). The aforementioned hairs all over the shower wall. And there's no way in the world they could've cleaned that bathtub....it definitely hasn't seen any kind of cleaner in a while. The draws on the door were enough for me; I showered with a towel on the tub floor cuz I just didnt want to touch anything in there.\n\nYou'd think as long as they took to get me a room here, the room would be sparkling! Now I'm starting to think all they did was make the bed, fold some towels, and move on.\n\nI really wanna just leave here and sleep somewhere else, but I already paid for the room. I'm mad at myself for going through Priceline...the cheaper rate I got is not worth the hassle this place has been. \n\nDon't do it.",,,,,,
1,"I flippin love this place!!! I have a weird love for Mexican Markets and this place kicks ass!!! You walk into this place and bam! Mexican Sweet Breads!! Oh, it's just starting there. Grab a few sweet breads (good luck trying to figure how it do it in a sanitary way) and make your way to the CANDLES!!! Yeah, they got every imaginable candle. Picked up a Pope John Paul candle and what's that? A wall of chicharones. Now I don't eat those, but shit they are very impressive! Now my A.D.D. is kicking into high gear!!!! Tortillas, salsa, tamales, more candles, crazy ass looking fruits, crazy ass looking marinated meats, I don't know what that is and my 4 years of Spanish isn't helping me read the label, pacifico, corona, tequila and so so much more. Phoenix Ranch Market is my Disneyland! Buckle up and enjoy the ride.",,,,,,
-1,"It's really not a bad place to watch a game.  Big TVs, decent beer choices, edible fried foods, nice staff.  With a few changes it could be a 4 star joint. \n\nBut here's the deal:  every time some schmo orders their signature two foot long hotdog  platter called the \""Big Unit\"" - a horrifying, shrill, alarm rings off and the staff simultaneously yells the eponymous name.  \n\nWhen I was there, 17 such \""Units\"" were purchased in rapid succession.   I watched the rest of the game in fear of another order.  \n\nThanks for the PTSD Alice Cooper!",,,,,,
1,This place is awesome! Staff is always friendly and food is always good! Wings are good and the crab puffs are amazing!,,,,,,
-1,"Poor, slow service. Food that was just okay. A manager who didn't want to make an effort to address either issue. The worst part was when we saw another table's food being brought out, with one plate of food stacked halfway on top of another plate of food. I would have flipped if I'd seen that with my order.\n\nI realize they were busy, I realize that our server was (by his admission) new. Doesn't excuse the fact that we didn't see him from the time we ordered to the time we got our check. Someone else brought our food. And the manager just blew off the mistakes. I wouldn't bother.",,,,,,
-1,"OK ...the truth will set you free......(deep breath)\n\nThis is one of my usual stops, I am now a regular here, but just do not get the desired effect of my relationship in my customer / business feeling thing with these guys.\n\nSince I have been yelping, I tend to be a little more optimistic in my approach of businesses keeping an eye on prejudices or preconceived feelings one may have toward certain situations, Now keep in mind that as a customer, I have needs. I need to fulfill my hunger, I need to fulfill my existence by having people listen to my needs as I request them, and most of all after my needs are met, I leave a small token of my appreciation in the form of a tip or gratuity. If my simple needs cannot be met, then I become very disappointed.  This is where yelping has become my source of self help.\n\nFor starters, my wife enjoys the food here, it is very affordable, and the food (when we get it) is usually very consistent (it is very good). On this evening we had a very simple fair, but as we were greeted by the \""chip / salsa\"" gentleman, we quickly requested a mild salsa.  (usually the standard as you are greeted is the medium / hot salsa and the OMG that is hot \""white salsa\"") Since my spanish is not very good, like a fool I spoke english very softly and slowly, \""M-I-L-D salsa please for the lady\"". Our mild salsa never arrived. This was the first sign that it was going to be an interesting night.\n\nUpon our server coming over, we had a tea and water (the tea is very sweet and makes my mom jealous....it is soooo good.) The server took our order, a single chicken and cheese quesadila, 2 soft beef tacos, and a side of rice.  Again, we asked the server for a side of mild salsa, and once again, it never came.\n\nIn the meantime, the food came out pretty quickly, but without the side of rice.  Now this is really starting to get under my skin....This is the best part of the meal as it is not greasy, it has good flavor, and is quite enjoyable, yet, in this meal, it NEVER showed.....The server apparently got sidetracked, we didn't see him for a few minutes, but as we did not have a large meal, it was over halfway gone.  We were soooooo disappointed as this was my recommendation for a lite fair tonight, and lite it was.  No mild salsa, no rice......why bother! \n\nSince I felt I was not appreciated, and my needs were not met, I felt like a bad date, and just wanted to break up right here! I'm feeling This Ends NOW! Sure the server apologized, but then reminded him that we never received the salsa we asked for TWICE!\n\nIt is times like this that I remember why I started Yelping, to search out the truth in restaurants and to hold every person in the hospitality business accountable for the lack of interest in the customer.\n\nThe customer deserves good service, good food, and at times a reasonable expectation of those needs.  \n\nI am in sales, my motto I live by is...... \""You can have price, quality or service, pick any two, but you are not going to get all three\""  in this case, I got price, but neither service nor quality was provided.\n\nSure I will be back, but with lower expectations.\n\nNCFoodGuy",,,,,,
-1,"Maybe I am missing what the big draw to Joe's is but I feel like C-U and Campustown have better bars around town. Being a grad student, I think the appeal is usually lost. The only plus is that they have my favorite cider (Strongbow) on tap. The service is okay and I am glad that they at least have their own beer. Their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay. Given the choice, I would choose other bars over Joe's.",,,,,,
1,"It's so difficult to find a good fish fry place in Phoenix but I think this is pretty good. I had the catfish and shrimp combo with fries. At first bite I was surprised at how great it was. Not bland at all like another nearby place. The shrimp was butterfly and the breading on both the catfish and the shrimp was really good....not too much and not too little. I think if you're looking for a place with good fried fish, you definitely need to check it out!!",,,,,,
-1,Weird airport setup. Not really a fan.,,,,,,

-1,"NEVER going back to this place.  We went for breakfast as a table of four.  It was packed, Sunday morning breakfast.  Three of the four breakfasts went back.  Two of those came wrong again.  One of those came back wrong a third time.  It took so long for the waitress to come back my wife had nibbled on it, eating around the block of Velveeta she specifically asked to be cheddar.  When we asked for consideration on the bill, we were told that she had eaten it, so no discount would be given.  We asked to see the manager.  The waitress returned and threw the bill on the table saying that she would take the breakfast out of her tips.  When we told the hostess, she offered a 10% discount off the bill.  Too Little Too Late.  There is no excuse for a menu omelet (that's right, not a special order, menu) to come out wrong three times.",,,,,,
-1,"This was the worst Mexican food I've ever had!! First off ordered a margarita came to the table looking very weak and it tasted even worse I had to send it back! I decided to just go with a draft beer which is very hard to screw up. They give you free chips with salsa the salsa was nothing special either no kick, then came the enchiladas I ordered one word Terrible too much cheese on top, shredded chicken with no flavor inside and not one decimal of spice! The service was slow and prices were way too high for this place! The only thing positive I have to say is the cervaza was cold",,,,,,
-1,"Ok, I'll admit, Phoenix has terrible BBQ.  If I were to rate Honey Bears in relation to other BBQ restaurants in the city, it'd get higher.  But this ain't no relative rating, and Phoenix needs some better BBQ.  So I'll continue.\n\nIf you like a sorry excuse for BBQ, this is it.  Meat tastes completely flavorless and dry save for the Memphis-style sauce.  Meats are not smoked, and I'm doubting whether they are actually even barbecued.  When you walk in, there is no aroma of BBQ, just meat.  Almost if they were oven cooked.\n\nMemphis style BBQ should be rubbed and smoked.  Meat should have a faint smoke ring and outside should be distinctively seasoned compared to the inside.  The sauce here is good and is a must to keep the food edible.  Sides are completely forgettable.  I gave Honey Bears 2 stars because the prices are good. \n\nFor those who think BBQ needs to be doused in sauce to be good, well, that's your opinion but contrary to popular belief the sauce should be a compliment to the already good seasoning of the meat.\n\nIn short - still waiting for a real BBQ restaurant.  This ain't it.",,,,,,
-1,"On my first trip to Charlotte, I noticed right away that there's really nowhere in the city you can't reach within 15 minutes. Absolutely anywhere. However, when walking around the CLT airport, any place you need to be is easily a 20 minute walk - if not longer.\n\nThe layout of CLT is terrible. The \""spokes off a hub\"" concourse design may have worked  a couple decades ago, but the space has just become over crowded. It also doesn't help when people who have no concept of the world around them will stop walking right in front of you. Then, in an attempt to get around them you're side-swiped by an electric cart for the 27th time. \n\nThe concourses themselves were a bit outdated, crowded, and felt like it had minimal air conditioning. Food selection all around was fried stuff or really good smelling BBQ, but had a good breakfast at the Nascar restaurant.\n\nThe one thing going for this place is the hospitality and friendliness of the employees - for the airport, TSA, airlines, and even restaurants. If you as much as give them a smile and a \""thanks much\"" they're beyond willing to go the extra mile for you. This was great since we had maintenance issues with our Delta flight. They booked us onto USAirways to make it right and gave us the direct flight back to DEN with 1st Class seats.\n\nThe rocking chairs in the atrium were a nice touch. Since we had 9 hours to kill, it was good to kick back, recharge our laptops, and play drinking games - anyone in a straw hat, and any electric cart is one drink.",,,,,,
1,"I had eaten here years ago. My family went again tonight because we had a Groupon. It was actually a great time. The waitress was VERY good- sorry I don't know her name. Shee was on my families refills. \n    The food was good- My husband had a calzone- He loved it. We had mozz sticks, maybe the best ones I've ever had. We had a 20 pc mild chicken wings. They were so far- my favorite milds. I'm picky because I can't take really hot stuff and these wings were tasty and good. Great size chicken too.\nWe had a pizza and it was ok. Not the best, Not even close to the worst. Nothing bad to say. I will go back for the wings:)",,,,,,

-1,"I was in the area.  I was about to go to Pho Nam but decided to try Chins.  \nMy first impression was that this was a lot like Noodles and company with a Chinese decor.  It fell short in ambiance and flavor for me.\nI ordered the Thai Noodles.\nThai Noodles: wide Asian noodles with bok choy, red onions, pea pods, and water\nchestnuts in coconut curry with Thai seasonings, garnished with lime,\nred pepper, and sprouts.\nI didn't feel like this had a lot of flavor.  It was barely coconut curry and actually had a flavor that was different from anything I have ever had before.   The vegetable were fresh and the portion was good.\nMy overall experience was so so but I still ended up having a good time because I was able to witness an exchange between some people that was something like a scene out of the movie Slacker by Linklater.  \nWhat happened is a person came in and recognized an old classmate.  They were friendly and greeted the other person with a hearty, \""Hey! How have you been.\""  The other person didn't recognize them.  He introduced himself and then they knew who he was but they were completely distant and uninterested.  It was awkward.  A true cringe moment.  Some people can be so cold and insensitive.  It went on for about 5 minutes and really made my stop there interesting. \nThere were a lot of people here from what it looked like they were on lunch from nearby businesses.",,,,,,

No warm welcome or even a smile and it was a manager who was besides himself for having to leave his set position to help me the only customer at noon in line. \nDining room looks great new.

Two people cannot use them at the same time because they're too close together, and there is no divider.

The problem with this is that I can't eat onions or cilantro... at all... I hate them.  So, I went with tostadas.  I had 1 chicken and 1 carne asada.  I enjoyed both very much!  The tostadas are very simple; layered bottom to top are: tostada shell, beans, meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes.  Both the chicken and carne asada were very flavorful, and while the beans were a bit watery, they tasted really good as well.\n\nThe place is tiny and crowded, but the service is very friendly and I think the quality of the food makes up for the downfalls.  This is probably my favorite Triple D place so far.",,,,,,

1,"We first used PreFlight in Boston and were happy to see it in Phoenix as well.\n\nOverall, our experience was great and similar to that of Boston's service.  A few days before, we pre-booked online, which I recommend since you get the best rates that way and don't have to fiddle with money upon check-out.  We parked and a shuttle arrived shortly after.  The drivers were courteous and helpful.\n\nUpon return, we gave them a quick call since it was after 10pm and they picked us up promptly from the terminal.  Checking out was quick enough.  They took our printed reservation page and we were on our way.  I saw the water vending machine right before the gate, but I didn't bother getting one.  I'm not sure where the newspapers that others have mentioned were located.\n\nWhy PreFlight over many of the competitors that also had good yelp reviews (Blue Sky, etc.)?  They have a presence in the BOS and BWI airports, among others, which means that we can earn points and use them at PreFlight places across the country.\n\nNote: Covered parking, which is slightly more expensive that uncovered, was canopy-style covering in the parking lot.  It wasn't a problem for us, but we were just expecting a garage.",,,,,,
1,"I got word of Gentleman Joe's recently and made my first visit a few days ago. This is probably the best haircut I have ever had, which I judge by the compliments I have been getting, as well as how it feels physically.\n\nIn the past, I have always went to those Super Clip Co. types of places and had my haircut by some woman that was more interested in speed than giving a great haircut. It was usually an 8-minute cut that turned out to be uneven and never really felt right. In fact, I would usually try to time my haircuts a week in advance of any important event, just so it could grow out and cover up the chop job. But at Gentleman Joe's, they take their time and are very precise. \n\nGentleman Joe's charges a little more (I paid about $20 plus tip) than those other places, but the result is far superior to the quick-cut places. These guys are skilled professionals. They understand how to cut men's hair and do a great job. I'm not sure if it was just gentleman (Moises) that cut my hair, but there was no small-talk, which was actually very refreshing to me. He spoke to me about how I styled my hair and what I wanted, then took his time and gave a great cut. I just got to sit back and watch the personal TV monitor in front of me. After I left the shop, I realized that the haircut actually felt good on my head. It seems weird to say a haircut can feel good physically, but it does. Also, I now only need a fraction of the hairgel that I normally needed after other haircuts I have had. I think that probably has something to do with the barber giving a more customized cut, as opposed to the generic cuts that I have received in the past.\n  \nI just wish I knew about Gentleman Joe's sooner. Even though it is a bit of a drive from where I live, I will be back every 3 or 4 weeks. They understand men's haircuts, take their time, are skilled professionals, don't talk to you about the weather, and don't try to sell you anything.

The elevators still have the classic rotating needle that shows what floor the elevator is on.  We stayed in the Governor's Suite, and it too was eking of nostalgia.\nUnfortunately some of the staff members did not have the same amount of charm to match the hotel's architecture and styling.  In particular, everyone we encountered at the front desk did not provide service you would expect at a classic establishment as this.  \nOn the other hand, the Valet Attendant exceeded my expectations.  He was very personable and helpful.  Furthermore, the bartender at the Ghost Lounge was equally personable and made us feel welcome each time we returned.  It appears that he recently purchased the lounge/bar.  He has a great personality and attitude.  I wish him the best.\nThe hotel is known for it's haunted nature.  I was not pleased to hear this.  Some may be attracted by this.  My over active mind kept me thinking of ghosts in the middle of the night. That's just my fault. \nOverall, a historic hotel with a lot of personality.  The hotel might benefit by training the front desk in proper hotel etiquette and professionalism.",,,,,,
-1,"Dude, this alleged 24 hour Dunkin' Donuts DOESN'T SELL DONUTS late nights!  Is it awesome to be really drunk in the middle of the night on saturday and go to get some donuts at the 24 hour dunkin' donuts, and it's OPEN but they DON'T HAVE DONUTS?  NO!!!!\n\nThe drive through is hella fast on weekday mornings, and the donuts are all always exactly like you'd expect from a dunkin' donuts (when they actually sell them.)",,,,,,
1,"The atmosphere in RA is a bit pretentious, fake and noisy. But I actually like the place. I enjoy sitting on the patio, having a few happy hour asahi's and maybe having a sake bomber or two. I only do this when the weather is nice, and try to avoid friday's or saturday's. \n\nAs far as the food, I have eaten at several sushi places throughout the country and they all taste a bit fishy to me. When I get sushi I actually like it to be a bit bland. I sampled some of the more exotic stuff, and it wasn't for me.\n\nSo, for not being a sushi aficionado, by avoiding the crowded times and coming to RA's during happy hour times (7-10 i think?) I actually enjoy it!",,,,,,
1,"We have been coming to this place for years and it never disappoints. I just wish we could come more often! I've had some of the sushi and the miso with salmon ramen, which I definitely recommend! My daughter says this is her favorite restaurant. She loves the cha-shu ramen and a pork dish that I can't remember the name of, guess we will have to go back to find out!!!",,,,,,

1,"Tasty burger!\n\nI hadn't been to a Whataburger in YEARS, but I was in the area and needed food. \n\nI ordered just a burger and drink. My first thought was that it was a little pricey at a little over $7, but I *did* order a double burger. \n\nThe people working there were very nice, service was fast, and the burger arrived hot and fresh. The double burger was worth the money, and the guy delivering it to my table asked if I needed condiments or a drink refill -- I thought that was nice.\n\nI got the green chile double burger, which consisted of two patties, two slices of cheese and a pile of green chiles on it -- they added a nice little kick. \n\nAs some other reviewers mentioned, the burgers are a bit on the juicy side, so that could be a problem if you're eating in the car or just don't like your burgers that way. Careful, they come out HOT enough to burn your mouth!",,,,,,
-1,"I am not sure why people like this place.  I have tried several locations and have dis-liked them all.  If I don't like a place I don't usually give it a second chance but  because I like to support local businesses and so many people rave about Macayo's I did try several locations.  Everyone says the one off of Mill Ave is good.  But I have wasted enough money at their restaurants.  It boggles my mind how a chain of such low quality can exist.  Any one of the numerous Mexican restaurants usually ending with \""o's\"" is better than this place.  \n\nThe reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember. Everything I have tasted is bland and seems like it came out of a can.  This chain helps perpetuate the stereotype of Mexican food being of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing people's mindset when I have them over for dinner.\n\nThe only nice quality of this location is the building is unique it looks like a mesoamerican  pyramid.",,,,,,
-1,"I was a longtime fan of the Rokerjj but, it has gone downhill. The service has declined and the food has declined. My guest steak was very undercooked then taken back and chopped up and recooked. No one wants a filet this way. My duck was tough and fatty. The wedge came out with NO salad dressing. The waitress insisted that it had dressing. The tastebuds do not lie!! No offer for coffee and desert.\nI was so sad after bringing our guests to dinner because I raved about the Rokerjj before dinner. What a shock!",,,,,,
1,"Solid, repeat: solid. I don't make it here that often, but when I do it's always rewarding. The most recent visit I had the buffalo chicken mac n cheese at the suggestion of our server. It was certainly not a healthy dish, but it was delicious. Every time I eat here I'm pleasantly surprised that it's not run-of-the-mill bar fare. Whoever they've got in the kitchen is putting thought into the product and it shows. \n\nThe atmosphere is rad. It's one part bar, one part restaurant from a decade or two ago, and part OTB. To sum it up - unique. And that's what I like. The service has never been an issue and I will most definitely return!",,,,,,
-1,Terrible service sitting at the bar for happy hour. My glass sat empty for long periods of time.   A passing waiter actually saw the empty glass and gave it to the bar tender. Sad.,,,,,,

-1,"If I could give 0 stars for this business I would!  Was totally ripped off!!!\nTook my car in to have NC Inspection.  While waiting, I could hear yelling coming from the service area.  After waiting 35-40 minutes the manager,  Will, came out and told me my car did not pass inspection and I needed new tires for it to pass. ( I had already been told by another employee they were fine).  I told Will that and he said \n\""well they won't pass for NC\"". I left without buying tires.  Went around the corner to another place of business and had my car inspected and it passed! No problems with the tires. Later  in the afternoon I received a car from the gentleman that does the state inspections for this Tire Kingdom.  He apologized to me and told me my car was really okay to pass inspection including the tires but his boss, Will, had told him to fail me so I would buy tires.  Inspector refused to fail me since it really was ok and that is what all the yelling I heard from the service area was about. He told me he could not go on knowing that I had been  cheated. He said he had to do what his boss said even though he is the one that is certified to do the inspections- NOT WILL.  Kudos for an honest person there even though the manager is a crook.  I made a complaint to Corporate and have had several conversations with someone \nfrom Corp.  They admitted Will was wrong and should not have done that!   \n\nHOWEVER, Will is still the manager there so BEWARE!  \n\nI was taken advantage of by  this business just so Will could sell some tires.  What does it say about the company that keeps someone like this on as an employee and especially as a manager!!???   \nANOTHER BEWARE- I went on Better Business Bureau  site to file a complaint.  You may want to read about this company on the BBB site before you think about doing business with them.",,,,,,

I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong..

1,"I'm on a huge Postino kick lately and had another awesome dinner there last night with five girlfriends.  Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!\n\nMy favorite menu items are still the same too:\nThe artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!\n\nI'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  \n\nService is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!\n\nOf course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.",,,,,,

1,"We've been fans of Dr. Gilchrist and the staff at Ingleside for four years, and we've been very happy with their work. We just wish they were closer to us in Chandler. \n\nTo begin, Dr. Gilchrist is very calm and helpful. He gives our cats thorough exams and doesn't make us feel rushed. He also doesn't try to push products the office sells. (There are multiple vets at this facility, but we prefer Dr. Gilchrist.)\n\nThe staff is very friendly. They even let our little tuxedo kitty climb over their desks and around their keyboards. They also handle our big orange tabby well despite how scared he usually is.\n\nThe building is modern and spacious, but the prices increased a little bit after they relocated to the new building.  The exam rooms are clean and neat. \n\nIf you prefer Saturday appointments, make sure to call as early as possible because Saturday slots go fast.",,,,,,
1,Have been coming here with the family for 20 years.  Family owned and always delicious. I like their mint iced tea and fattouch salad. The sleepy gyro is always great too. My dad loves the falafel pita and my aunt comes all the way from Chicago to have their spicy feta fries.   Try it out!,,,,,,
-1,"Ive had scorpions in the apartment and the tenant who lives above me said he gets a quite a few each month and has been stung multiple times.\nManagement (Andris) is horrible and non-caring. They are almost never in the office during their business hours, and if you try to call them to deal with an issue instead, don't expect a return call from them.\nOnly one way in or out of the gated parking lot and one evening the gate broke. No one could get in or out for over 2hrs until the emergency maintenance crew (who live off site), got there. \nWhen i viewed the apartment, they had potpourri going, that should have been my first clue not to lease. Te buildings are old and smell as such no matter what. The guy above me is a chain smoker and it leaks into my apartment via the air ducts.\nI told the leasing agent i only wanted a 9 month lease but when the papers were drawn up, they changed it to 12 months. It was my fault for not correcting it, but no I want out of the lease after 9 months and they could care less about my reasons for needing to move.  \nIf there were a way to put no stars, I would!\nDo not rent an apartment here!",,,,,,
1,"One of my all time favorite seafood restaurants in the Valley. The selection is large and always fresh, thanks to the company's fleet of fishing ships and expedited shipping. The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a high-end restaurant, as well. Pricey, but well worth it.",,,,,,
1,"The main advice I would give anyone interested in dining at Postino Arcadia would be: \""Prepare to Fight.\""  Prepare to fight for a parking space and prepare to fight for the bruschetta which is to die for.  My favorites would have to be the Smoked Salmon and Pesto, Apple and Brie, Prosciutto and Fig and Warm Artichoke.  Plus, you cannot beat a bottle of vino and 4 types of bruschetta for $20 every Monday and Tuesday after 8pm!\n\nI am also a huge fan of their Pretzel Pub Board and NYC Grilled Cheese that is companied by a Sierra Nevada Mustard, Pesto and Ketchup dipping sauces, washed down with a cold Stella Artois Lager Belgium.  These menu items have sparked inspiration for me to make similar dishes in my own kitchen more than a time or two.  So grab some good company, a bottle of vino paired with bruschetta and prepare for a relaxing-enjoyable night out.\n\nDon't forget the Affogato (vanilla bean ice cream topped with espresso) to give ya a jolt for your car ride home.",,,,,,
1,"I traveled from Michigan, seeking the best team of dentists to remove a failing implant and replace a front tooth that had to be extracted in 2009. I am fortunate in that I can travel for what I have researched and feel is the best dental care possible.\nI have had three procedures completed in Dr. Day's office since September 2012. I've been in his office possibly seven times in the last 15 months. Every time I've been in his office I was always greeted cordially by his staff. My appointment times that were scheduled never were late. Dr. Day's office is on time. Offices I had been to in Michigan sometimes let me sit and wait for over 60 minutes beyond the scheduled appointment time. Dr. Day himself always greets his patients. Once when I was waiting to see him, I could hear his assistant begin to brief him on my case and he quickly replied that he knew my case history clearly. Dr. Day prepares for his patients.   \nHe truly cares about his patients' comfort level while undergoing a procedure. I never was in any pain or discomfort during any of the procedures in Dr. Day's office. \nEvery time I've had a procedure completed, (implant removed, implant placed, gum adjustment) the healing has gone smoothly. I have never left his office and subsequently gotten an infection or had any other complications post-surgery. \nI am a musician and I look forward to getting back to playing my flute, piccolo and oboe. These lifelong activities would not be possible, if it wasn't for Dr. Day's skill as a surgeon and his complete attention to detail. \nEach time I have been in Dr. Day's office I get the feeling that Dr. Day and his staff truly function as a team; one that is friendly and caring. Dr. Day and his staff are 100% professional, confident and sincere. \nUnfortunately, I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I can't recommend him to too many friends and family due to the 2,000 miles between his office and my home, but I have let the dozen or so friends I have in Phoenix know he is the oral surgeon to see.  Dr. Day and his colleague Dr. Chal have ended nearly six years of dental misery and for that I am forever grateful. \nSusan S.",,,,,,

-1,"Don't Get Married Here. My husband and I got married in July. We had sit down dinner and chose 3 meals for our guests to choose from. The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's. This place is beautiful but not worth the money, stress, or headache.",,,,,,
1,"I love this place!  I just recently moved to San Francisco from Arizona, but I already made sure to visit it on my first trip back.  I have never brought someone there and had them not like it. \n\nThe atmosphere is great - small and cozy, and very warmly decorated for a former post office.  The wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts, and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar.   Service is typically good unless they are super busy (Friday and Saturday).\n\nIn addition to the wine choices, the bruschetta is awesome!  My favorite is the red pepper goat cheese, but I've also heard very good things about the proscuitto/mascarpone/fig one.  You order a sampler of four different types at a time - and there is a pretty even mix of vegetarian and meat options.\n\nThe only problem is that location is less than desirable for people in the SE Valley - it is a far drive from Chandler or Gilbert to the Arcadia neighborhood in Phoenix.  Here's a tip though: when you get there, don't wait for someone to leave or pay for the valet parking in the crowded lot, there is plenty of parking available for free in the side streets nearby.",,,,,,

Best advise would be to call in your order for pick up, as not much seating available because of the seemingly non-stop flow of customers.",,,,,,
-1,"Tonight my fianc\u00e9 and I took my parents to Cheesecake Factory to catch up over a slice of cheesecake and a cup of coffee (it was 5:30PM) We got our coffees right away, but had to ask for water twice. After about 30 minutes we had asked for our check and a box from our waitress. 20-25 minutes went by and we asked again, she said \""I'll be right back.\"" Another 20 minutes goes by and we tracked down the manager. He apologized and said he would have the check right out to us. At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip.

-1,"Lets just say... This place knows how to cut costs! I know that the economy has been hard on everyone, but whoa. I commend this restaurant for taking actions to minimize the amount they spend. This nice restaurant I believe sunk $5 million dollars on the property. Now, I'm going to update my review from my 2011 review. And the outcome, as you can tell by the stars is ummm... not good.\n\nNow, lets start off by the menu. I came with a party of 5 and we all got seated down at the hibachi grill. Menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes. I came to Nakato because from word, the owner owns a farm out in Colorado and farm raises all the animals and also their freezer blast freezes their seafood. This is an important fact because when you blast freeze seafood, it's usually 50 or more below 0 degrees Fahrenheit keeping the seafood fresh and bacteria free. So, this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out.\n\nSo, lets get back to the menu. Looking at the items something pops out. Fried Rice..$1.75. So, fried rice doesn't come standard with the meal that costs $15+? Steam rice on the other hand is free (which I picked). I ordered the combination of Chicken and NY strip. My party all got the fried rice when it was asked because they were under the assumption that it came with the meal, and I'll break down to you what that fried rice consisted of.\n\nFried rice: Eggs, Sesame seed, and Soy Sauce. That's it. No green onions, carrots, and all that other good stuff. On top of the lack of extras with the fried rice it had no taste. Bland.\n\nMeats that I ordered weren't bad on the other hand, but the portions were a little too small in my opinion. Their noodles that also came with the meal wasn't filling, and just left me a feeling of not full but at the same time not hungry. And mind, I ate two of my party's portion on noodles.\n\nWe also had some tempura. The tempura, I had no taste for it. I've definitely had better. The batter had no taste, as well as the sauce. The veggies that was served in the batter surprised my mother, which found out it was just a whole half of an onion dipped and fried in the tempura. She also wanted to tell me that what made it worse was that the onion had no flavor, the batter, and on top of all that the sauce!\n\nFinally lets get on with the end when we pay our bills.\nSitting with us at our grill was another party of 5, 3 kids and 2 adults. One of the child's birthday happened to be that day. So, you usually get a dessert, or a cupcake, or some ice cream right? Not here! This lucky girl got a nice candle, in a sauce dish. Well, they did sing the birthday song to her.\n\nBut wait! That's not it! The table sitting directly across from us also had a birthday. So, they take the candle the little girl just blew out and lights it again to give it to the other birthday person. Mind, these meals cost I believe $15+. Easily.\n\nWay to cheap out your customers there, Nakato. Charge extra for fried rice that's bland, and some pretty expensive dishes, with no complimentary birthday dessert. Now, that's how you run a business: Cutting costs, and try to recuperate losses.",,,,,,

-1,"I seriously don't know how this place rates a three star average. Just like many other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place. The concept is great! But that's it, it's just a concept. The food is as sterile as the environment. The only thing that distinguishes one dish from the other is the texture... each item has the same bland taste. And as I am somewhat of a foodie, the thing that is most amazing is that I know you have to work to make food this blah. The ingredients seem fresh, they seem to have herbies and such to make them look good, but everything tastes like they boiled it until all the flavor was released, removed the food and tossed the good flavored broth.\n\nI suppose if one of your favorite food combinations is mayonaise on white bread you might be impressed, but IMHO save your money and take yourself anywhere else.  :)",,,,,,

But the staff leaves the coffee too long - it always tastes burnt / bitter / terrible (just go next door and get a Starbucks). They also take no interest in the cleanliness of the place - I have never seen someone come out and wipe down tables or sweep up debris. Staff turnover is high and competence is low; they tend to have an attitude.",,,,,,

An order estimated at 30 minutes still wasn't here 1.5 hours later so I called and they claimed it had just left. They called up from the call box once and then left within seconds. (For whatever reason it went straight to voicemail, which I got notification of immediately.) I literally ran down and circled the lot and they were long gone. The store then pretended they couldn't hear me when I called from numerous phones and numbers until finally I interrupted their speech about the promotion and called them out for stuttering since they clearly heard me. (Before that they'd say the special really fast and immediately say \""hello? hello?\"" and hang up.) I will never order from this location again.",,,,,,

I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.  They are so excited to help you!",,,,,,
-1,"Absolute  waste of time contacting Allied.  The phone lackey bragged about their BBB rating.  Then, the agent scoped out my apartment and was professional and friendly, entering lot's of data in a 1980's computer.  She promised a quote the next day, which I never received.  No one from Allied ever contacted me again.\n\nGo with a real mover like ABF, or some company which actually exhibits a bit of professionalism.",,,,,,
1,I stopped by Keegan's to eat corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day. I've never ordered this dish before so I didn't know if I was going to like it or not. I ended up loving it!  The corned beef was lean and tender and the veggies were perfectly seasoned. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. I'd definitely come back to try other items on the menu.,,,,,,
1,"I've flown out of terminal 4 & 2. Don't think I've ever been in 3. As a kid I used to love the moving sidewalks in 4. Now as an adult I seem to always fly out of 2.\n\nMy last trip out went well. My flight was for 6:30am. I showed up at about 5am & made it to the gate with 20 min to spare. It was ridiculously easy to park in the West Economy lot & walk right to terminal 2.\n\nThere didn't seem to be enough people working to hand out boarding passes or take your luggage you want to check. We had to stand there and wait for a while even though there were hardly any people in line at the time. Also, the guy that took our luggage was rather grumpy.\n\nThe security line went well. The people working security were actually rather nice. I forgot to take my shoes off & the guy joked with me about it while I took them off.\n\nAll in all, I've always liked my home town airport.",,,,,,
-1,"Bowling+ Alcohol+Rock and Roll+ Cool Lights = Good Times..and low bowling scores!!!!\n\n\nSo AMF is OK..I have experienced better.  This location is your typical hometown bowling alley minus the line dancing or Karoke on Friday and Saturday nights...at least that's what my hometown bowling alley had.\n\nOh wait so does this AMF in the bar...speaking of the bar...most of the staff here sucks and for the majority are probably older then this bowling alley itself, the drinks suck for the most part...the only thing I have had here that tastes halfway decent is the Long Island Ice Tea...but even a blind monkey could not mess making one of these drinks it is virtually impossible. \n\nPrices are OK, the Rock and Roll bowling is cool but I think it is about time this place maybe did a remodel, all the balls are quite old and most of them need a good refurbishing. Plus it is kind of dirty, but what can you expect for a Bowling Alley..just go and look at the mix of freaks on any league night. \n\nNUFF SAID!!!:)\n\nI am still searching for a \""GOOD\"" bowling alley.",,,,,,
1,"This was on my Bookmark list and was also pretty close to work.  I was browsing their website and one of my coworkers saw my computer screen.  He gave me the thumbs up and told me that Spinatos was his favorite.  I decided to try it out.  I called in my order for an 11 inch Mama Spinatos Signature Spinach Pizza.  Drove down and picked it up.  Here is how it was.......\n\nSpinach Pizza-  I parked my car in a random lot and decided to dig in.  The pizza is Chicago style thin crust.  They cut it into small triangles and squares.  It looked amazing.  It was topped with cheese, spinach, tomatoes and garlic.  The ingredients were fresh as can be plus they were plentiful.   The taste was great!  The sauce was a little sweet, the cheese was melted nice, the spinach and tomatoes were awesome plus it had a nice garlic punch too.  The crust was just alright though.  It was a little too soft for my liking.  Maybe because it was for pickup?  Maybe it had too many toppings?  It wasn't horrible but if it was more crispy, it would have been way better than it already was.\n\nService was extremely friendly on the phone and during pickup.  Bonus points for having fantastic napkins!  They are basically 2\u00d72 squares of thick paper towel like napkins.  Possibly the best napkins I have ever been issued for a takeout spot lol.  I will be back to try out some other pizzas in the near future...probably dine in to see if the crust is crisper.  Overall, I was impressed though.  It was a very good pizza!",,,,,,

-1,"This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \""chicken maputo\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\"".  Does the average diner know what \""maputo\"" and \""piri piri\"" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.",,,,,,
1,"For ramen and broth fanatics, this is literally as good as it gets. Always very busy, and there's a reason for it. PLEASE Cherryblossom, if you're listening, launch a location in OldTown. \n\nCha Shu Ramen #1 must, however definitely go with the egg noodles in this one. Smoky, creamy broth will have you feening. \n\nUdon Suki Pot #2 must, they crack a raw egg on top to finish it off and the broth is so hot it cooks it. Deliciously flavorful beef broth.\n\nSpicy Gyoza Soup Appetizer #3 must. Must. Must. Must. Warning, it is actually extremely spicy, it will make your nose run. But I literally had a couple dreams about it, it was that good. \n\nI actually didn't like the champon noodles very much, but might be a personal preference. The tan-tan men noodles were very good as well. Sushi is decent. Haven't tried the asian-italian fusion dishes but my ex always ordered one and they looked absolutely fantastic.",,,,,,
1,"I can completely thank Yelp App for this great find, I was way too early to head into work and wanted some breakfast and not from a fast food chain, so I looked what was in the area and found the Nosh Cafe so off I went.\n\nWhen I got there it had a little line, but don't worry, it moves sort of fast, while waiting in line I checked out the menu board and saw they had a lot going on, that I want to try it all, but I had to limit my choice to just one this time around.\n\nNow they have breakfasts off the grill and breakfast sandwiches, so I knew the sandwiched sounded good, so I checked out the selection and went with the Ranchero on a jalapeno bagel and a large caramel latte. The Ranchero was egg, sausage, red onion & house made southwest cream cheese; it was a great breakfast bagel sandwich.\n\nHappy to had found Nosh Cafe, and saw they do lunch and its less than 2 miles from my work, so I can pretty much say I will be back again soon.",,,,,,

Is their septic tank backed up? do their employees shower in sulfur springs?\nwhat is up with that stank in this place!? I've been here twice now and each time it reeked of rotten eggs.

1,"When I travel and need to leave my car parked somewhere, I choose to use PreFlight.  Since my last review over 2 yrs ago, I've continued to use this service.  It's located a short distance from the airport, but it's significantly cheaper than parking at the airport, so you can save some money.  They also have coupons available which add to the savings.\n\nI'm glad a friend referred me to this place early on.  Since then, I've recommended it to many friends and associates.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%",,,,,,
1,"Although I love Gallagher's and this is my neighborhood standby for a quick and easy frothy adult beverage with friends, I was first leaning toward giving only four stars -- mainly because the quality of the \""fresher\"" elements of the food (i.e. lettuce, jalapenos, etc.) is not especially consistent. But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: \n\n*FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) \n\n*Build your own burger - not only can you pick your \""meat\"" but you can pick your \""bun\"" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. \n\n*Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) \n\n* Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had \""Reserved For...\"" signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my \""#1 go to watch a game\"" spot for all time. \n\nP.S. If your preference is \""fake cheese\"" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley. (If you like real cheese on your nachos, you are on your own!!)",,,,,,

-1,"Okay food, terrible, slow and arrogant service.  You guys need to change your attitude.  The server could have cared less about her service, ignored, us and the food took forever! Not even an acknolwedgement from the staff that the food was taking too long. Also, we were sat down about 15 to 30 min after our seating time and there was not enough space for us to sit to wait for our table as there are only 4 chairs - 2 back to back so I had to sit on the edge as there were several of us. After asking to get a drink a waitress shoved a menu in my face and said she would take my order and never came around. We also had to chase our check down as well.",,,,,,
-1,"What a bummer. We read the reviews before going to this place with full intention of ordering off the black menu... Unfortunately we are boring white people who were too scared of the unknown dishes so we ordered orange chicken, mongolian beef, general tsao's chicken, crab wontons, beef chow mein, sweet and sour soup, and egg rolls. The soup was great, warm, spicy, big chunks of tofu and pork. Everything else was mediocre at best. The entrees were nothing more than goopy cornstarch sauce with little to-no flavor, the meats and vegetables in everything seemed to be fresh and of good quality but were coated in batter and perhaps just barely fried- leaving them covered in soggy mush that has absorbed the goopy flavorless sauces. Nothing other than the soup was spicy, not even a hint of heat- never-mind the little pepper next to the items on the menu indicating the heat level. It was a giant waste of money and if we hadn't ordered take-out we definitely would have gotten our money back. We've now got a fridge full of left-overs that we're dreading eating. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. I imagine the black menu is tastier, but it's ridiculous to have two menus with food of completely different quality levels rather than levels of authenticity. \n\nMoral of the story: Gross. Flavorless. A gigantic waste of time and money. We're so disappointed.",,,,,,
1,"Transport from terminal convenient.  Check in was fast.  The clerk who checked us in while not overly friendly was effecient.   When we got to the assigned car it was apparent it was used by a smoker...there was even a burn hole in the back seat.  When we complained to the desk in the parking garage we got an immediate apology and a change to a super clean car.  Best of all upon our return home my husband discovered he left his own garmin in the car.  We thought we had seen the last of it, but after a call to Budget, they put the car on \""hold\"" until they could search it, found it and are returning it to us via Fed Ex.  We appreciate the extra mile by the staff at Sky Harbor!",,,,,,

Good drinks, possibly best chai I have ever had.  the side potato salad is very tasty.  Not a huge fan of the egg-whiches.  the croissant is a little too hard.\n\nAtmosphere:   Nice patio;  little garden and a bunch of colorful artist bungalows.  sweeps in the zen like relaxation for a lazy sunday or friday lunch.",,,,,,

1,"I had a pedicure at this place today. The prices are excellent. I paid $22 for the best pedicure I can ever remember getting and I have paid $60+ in some places. I kept expecting to pay more thinking they must be giving me the deluxe pedi instead of the basic one but nope the one I got was the basic one. I'm not even sure what they might add if they have a deluxe pedi accept maybe a paraffin dip or an herbal wrap?\nThey have an attractive clean facility. They actually line the basin where your feet go with a plastic liner that they change between customers, now that is clean! The chairs themselves look brand new. I got the longest foot massage I have ever had with a pedi even when I paid for a so-called deluxe or spa pedi elsewhere. My toes looked great when they were done. I was offered a bottle of water to drink while I waited. I know some places will give you wine, coffee etc but this is not a spa and for that price I am more than happy with water (besides I have to drive).\nBtw, they have male clients as well. In case you guys want to experience one of the things that makes it great to be a woman. \nThe staff was so pleasant and most of them are English speaking. What more could you ask for? Hanna was the girl that did my feet but I saw the others working and they all seemed to do quality work. I am so excited that I found a great affordable place to get some regular pedicures while I'm here. If I can only find a good massage around here I will be in heaven. \nI give them 5 stars because they are better than any spa I have ever been to and a third the price.",,,,,,
-1,"Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.\n\nSo, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again.",,,,,,
-1,"yes they have so much stuff.  all that stuff though is overpriced.  they need some sort of discount service where every $100 you spend there you get $10 off of a purchase.  maybe they already have something like this (i doubt it), but i'm not going to set foot in that place again til i have to, which will be once a week come this fall.",,,,,,
-1,"I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be true. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good. \n\nI work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a \""large sandwich\"" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves. \n\nService is all business. I don't think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times. \n\nJust not impressed at all. But...it beats the Burger King down the street which is the worst BK in Christendom. But that is another review.",,,,,,
-1,"First off, the chef's mortadella and creme fraiche didn't amuse my bouche. Second, my gnocchi tasted like it came out of a Bertolli bag in the frozen section at a supermarket and the sauce was inundated with salt. After trying some parmesan, which was freshly grated (about the only positive), and pepper flakes, I realized that nothing could save the dish. If you want to pay Chicago prices to impress a date, you can try Bocaro, but don't expect more than oversalted Champaign food.",,,,,,

-1,"This place offers a sliver of charm for those who shop/stroll along Walnut St. and want to drop in for an espresso. It has a big clear garage window which is always open when weather permits - and this allows for good people watching. Nevertheless, it still lacks some of the warmth and welcome that you find in other independent coffee shops. Although there are a lot of electrical outlets, this place may not be the best spot to study for a couple hours (esp. during weekend peak times). Tables can be scarce and it seems like the owner/staff are less than thrilled about a bunch of sweatshirt clad students detracting from the Walnut St. bistro-charm. If you still decide to hit the books, there is a semi-soundproof room in the back where some like to study, however it also serves as a \""community room\"" that is periodically reserved. Prices on coffee are decent, but the food and desserts are way over-priced and disappointing to the palate.",,,,,,
-1,"While this isn't the fanciest of places by any means (two hand-written signs on the wall proclaim \""no cigar smoking in restaurant\""), the food is quite decent.  Also be forewarned, this is certainly a local hangout, and as such you won't find niceties such as a hostess (you have to seat yourself) and they don't have a non-smoking section (all tables are smoking).  That's the way that the clientele likes it, and if you can get past those things, the prices are decent, the service quick, if not exactly stellar, and the food hot.\n\nThe quality of the food may not exactly be the best, but let's face it - when you're at a 24-hour eatery, you aren't always looking for the best food, are you?  Most times when you stop at a joint like this, you're looking for the fastest service, and as long as it's edible, it will be fine.  This location is no exception to that rule.  The food does quite well in that regard, in fact, and might even exceed your expectations.",,,,,,
1,"Wow. Even on a weekday evening with no one inside, this bar is worth visiting. It's set up speakeasy style with only a placard near the entrance door with the name on it. The inside is very dark and sultry. Lights shine on black and grey photos/ artwork above the bar. There are couches and tables. Our group relaxed on some couches and ordered several drinks off the menu and shared. Their take on the old fashioned was delicious. Though I can't remember the name, the rosemary-topped gin based martini was the absolute best. This place is fancy, for sure, but they don't seem to mind a flip flop before 7 or 8pm. Great services as well.",,,,,,
1,"Islands... Something about the name in collaboration with the tropical sign that makes you feel like you are going to a wonderful amusement park for adults.  A place where you can relax on a beach with endless Mai Tais and feast on rotisserie style pig with pineapples.  Where dolphins spray you with mist from their little snorkel holes and Ariel gives you a lap dance. Okay, I probably took that a little too far, but you get the idea.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the REAL Islands isn't much different than my fantasy restaurant in the Bahamas.  I mean, take away the dolphins, the pig, and the pornographic Disney character and you are right on the money!  Their drinks are marvelous and their burgers are insane!!! I mean psychiatric ward insane! You can take your 80 year old granny to Islands, and one bite of the Bluenami, and she will be ON the table doing the Arsenio Hall \""Woo! Woo!\""... It just does that to people.  That is why the LAST time I visited this place, I stayed FAR away from the burgers.\n\nI got the nachos.  I mean really, how can you go wrong with nachos? You can't, and believe me... Islands DELIVERED! It wasn't your typical 2 foot pile of tortilla chips with cheese and everything else.  It was a beautifully made craft of corn tortillas. The binding agent was an aromatic and delicious blend of cheeses that also cooled the palette from those commercial jalapenos.  It arrived with glistening globules of sour cream. The fresh stuff. I could have just stuck my spoon in it and eaten it all by itself. I didn't, of course... That would be nacho sacrilege!!! Olives, Beans, and Hot Sauce... enough said, right? I think so.\n\nThe service was impeccable.  Aside from our waiter constantly calling me \""Boss\"" and winking at my wife, it was perfection... I can't STAND to be called \""Boss\""... Seriously. No, really.",,,,,,

1,"This place is super cool. The only bad thing about it, is that it got TOO popular! I am very happy for the success of this place. At least they made the place bigger. There was a period of a year where i ate at this place saturday and sunday for breakfast! i was addicted. One thing i like to do if its really busy is to call your order in, so you dont have to wait in line. The only down fall is sometimes your toast gets soggy!\nParking is a pain in the butt for this place.\nThis is place is a big hit for people of all ages and its a great place to chat.\nMy fave is croque monsieur.

-1,"It's a basic, few frills theater.  Their screens are a little too small for this day and age, which I assume they'll be fixing when they build the new location in Sun Prairie.\n\nI go to a lot of movies, and this theater is really no better or worse than most other theaters I've been to, and given that this is closest to my home, it receives the majority of my business.\n\nMy favorite part of this theater is the fact that I usually go to the bathroom before a show (who doesn't really?).  I always use the same bathroom (the smaller one to the right), and I usually end up at the first urinal when I go in.  At the first urinal, a few years ago, some dude wiped a nasal nugget on the wall when he was doing his business.  That wall widget happened to be nearly the same color as the tile in the men's room.  Now, every time I go in there, I look for it.  It's still there, over 4+ years now.\n\nWay to clean the bathrooms, Eastgate!",,,,,,

I don't care if you buy the whole bag or none of it, that decision alone should suffice. \nI also don't care to know what you personally think about the design aesthetic of a brand. After so many years of exemplary service in both the sales and buying departments it annoys me to see the tittle of buyer handed out to whomever.",,,,,,
-1,"Well, I agree...never again with Hertz at CLT airport.  20 min wait for shuttle followed by huge lines and 2 clerks at off site location.  Then we went out to find a car with dents and scratches and no one wanting to document the damage.  Guy walking around cars said person at gate would do it as we left and then \""...ita\"" at the gate nastily told us that was not her job.  Her comment was to document it myself and then she would date stamp it.  SO I wound up walking around and writing down all the damage and photographing the car while everyone trying to leave waited.  There was NO way I was going to leave without documentation that I wasn't the one that made all the damage.  I'm sure they would have become very efficient then!  I was Totally disappointed in Hertz.  I thought they were better than this experience illustrated!",,,,,,
-1,"I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\n\nFrench onion\nChicken bites\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\n\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \n\nI really never want to return.",,,,,,
-1,"Visiting from San Francisco. Food was mediocre at best. Bland is the best description.  Sausages and  Weiner Schmitzel were unremarkable. Best was the sweet & sour cabbage that accompanied. But also served were over-boiled 'daily vegetable' of snap peas, asparagus, and red peppers.... to the point that they were losing their color. Good beer. Yes it has old photos of days gone by... but really there seemed no joy here now...",,,,,,
-1,"Well, this is the 2nd time my fiance and I have been here. I must say, I'm disappointed.  We came during AZ Spring Restaurant week, so the menu was limited- we had the filet, the short ribs, cesar salad, tortilla soup, chocolate tarte, and berry tarte, ALL were excellently tasty! What I didn't like is their problem with gratuity. The first time we went here, they tagged on a 20% gratuity to the bill for no apparent reason- \""meh, maybe its their policy\"". So, this time the restaurant week menu specifies that gratuity  will be added to the ticket- but the older folks next to us (mind you, the tables are VERY close together) ordered the EXACT same thing and their ticket was $15 less than ours. Disappointing- especially since the pregnant waitress in flip-flops took care of almost the entire dining room and paid very little attention to us. So, we're a bit disappointed by this discrepancy, and won't be returning. Too bad, the chocolate tarte was delish.",,,,,,
1,"As little kids we indulge in painting, playing with clay, drawing, doodling, music, and all sorts of other creative things. However, as adults sometimes it seems that even listening to music can be a hassle to our busy schedules. \n\nAs You Wish is a great excuse to go and be a kid again. All those things we do as kids are relaxing and allow us to operate parts of our brains we probably don't get to in our careers/jobs. You don't need to be an artist or have any art skills to do this stuff, just come to have fun. Will your piece come out looking like something you want to put on the mantle? Probably not - but that isn't the point... the point is that you are going to have fun.\n\nI can see this as being really fun to do with your kids if they are kind of craft/artsy. I know as a kid, I would have loved doing stuff like this.\n\nSo what removes this place from a 5-star? Price and music. Just to come in it is $8 per person and then whatever the cost of the pottery piece you pick. It is a little pricey, but meh, this isn't the place you are going to be making a full dinner set. The in-store music was kind of bleh as well. It may be advisable to come with an MP3 player or something and just zone out in your own music instead of whatever random stuff is playing on their radio.\n\nThis is somewhat of a side note, but make sure that you give yourself enough time to paint. Every place you paint has to be painted with 3 coats... and if you have a large piece, then that is going to take forever. Furthermore, if you are planning on something intricate/complicated... just remember that you are going to have to do the exact same design three times. It is more difficult than it seems.\n\nOverall, it was fun. I'd like to go back. you can also get their cards and get discounts. Also, look online for coupons. You can get $2 off the sitting-fee or something like that.",,,,,,
1,"I went to a Christmas party that had Avanti cater.  It was fantastic.  It was the first time the family had used them, and I swore they had been in the home a million times.  The server treated everyone like family and the food was fantastic.  We began with ravoli, then a real caesar, and Osso Bucco complete with a marrow fork.  I was too full to even have the tiramisu.  This could not have been cheap, but a lasting impression is rarely affordable!",,,,,,

-1,"I can't figure out the hype surrounding the burgers here.  It's at or near the top of more \""Best Burger in Pittsburgh\"" lists than not, and some people have gone so far as to name it the best burger in the state.  I've had burgers at well over 100 places in this state, and let me tell you, Tessaro's isn't even average.\n\nThe ingredients were of good quality, but both creativity in design and skill in preparation were sorely lacking.  I went with a group of five, and not one of us enjoyed the burger.  Also, not one of us got ours cooked as ordered.  I'm willing to accept a variety of interpretations of \""medium rare\"" but no pink and dry throughout is not one of them.\n\nThough shamefully mistreated, the meat's natural flavor, along with non-burger items, rescued Tessaro's from one star territory, but it was pretty obvious the clueless kitchen couldn't hold up to real competition.  (If you want a decent burger, try Burgatory.)",,,,,,
-1,"First off let me say that I am definitely a city girl so restaurants like Esquire are not really my type. I have dietary restrictions and I need to be picky. I came here with my mom and sister to grab some food on Sunday. It seemed to be the only place open. I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich (super bland), my sister got the chicken salad (she said it was pretty good), and my mom ordered the salmon.\n\nOverall the food was nothing special to me however coming from the city to this little suburb area the price for the food was pretty amazing. The salmon only cost $7 and it was a fairly big portion. \n\nThe servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load. I wont be back here but that mostly has to do with the lack of food options.",,,,,,

A little hidden gem. The decor made me feel like I was somewhere else- I felt like I should have dressed nicer! It's very classy inside and the chairs are so comfy which is always a plus. \n     \nThe bread was so good, we ended up asking for more twice! My friend got the cheese ravioli which was awesome, and my dad got the chicken piccata- yumm. I got the tortellini with mushrooms in alfredo sauce and it was so good. Creamy and rich and just what I want when I think Italian food. My parents appreciated the complimentary amaretto at the end! \n\nI will definitely come back here if I'm in the area again. It was all an Italian restaurant should be!",,,,,,
1,"I've always been a big fan of Postino but don't make it down there very often. A couple of weeks ago I met some friends to hike Camelback. After a struggling hike, we went to Postino to enjoy some food and drinks. What a perfect day! \n\nWe sat outside on the patio and were cooled by misters. Our attentive servers brought us water right away. I started with fresh squeezed lemonade then had a mimosa. My friend and a bellini and the guys had some IPA (I think it was $5 a pitcher??) \n\nI can't go to Postino without having some of their infamous bruschetta... we ordered the artichoke, tomato jam, prosciutto/fig, and date/pistachio. Every bite was delicious! Can't wait to go back!",,,,,,
1,"So I came to this David's Bridal hearing extremely mixed opinions about their stores as a whole. I was honestly expecting a less than great experience. Reading reviews, it seemed like this one was better than other DBs in Phoenix. I made an appointment online, which was really convenient.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how bright and clean the store was. The girl that greeted me and checked me in was nice and let me browse around for about 20 minutes since I was very early for my appointment. \n\nMy consultant, Brittani, was extremely nice and friendly (not fake or pushy), so I was glad that I got her! I already picked out my favorite dresses online and she had them pulled when my appointment started. Impressive. The dress that was my FAVORITE was not there though, and they only carried it in Plus sizes even though they have it online in regular sizes too. That was pretty disappointing. \n\nThey gave me a bustier that did not fit at all and had make up stains on it from being pulled down over clown make up, so that kind of sucked. I had my own bra but they want you to wear their bustier. It didn't really matter though when the dresses are pulled up against you so you're \""in place\"" anyway.\n\nSome dresses were really nice, others were clearly cheaper fabric. Everything I tried on I already liked since I spent a lot of time picking them prior to the visit. I definitely recommend doing that so you can avoid wasting your time looking at dresses still in their bags or having a consultant pick them for you. \n\nAlterations are expensive, be aware.\n\nGet a weekday DAYTIME appointment if you can. I had a 2pm appointment on a Monday and I had my consultant to myself and there wasn't many people there.\n\nI like the price range that David's Bridal has, they have dresses for any budget. Cheaper dresses for less than $200 and a couple designers up to $1200-ish. \n\nI had a good time trying the dresses on, they have an awesome selection for the price. I had two favorites but ultimately found \""the dress\"" somewhere else the next day. \n\nDavid's is GREAT for bridesmaids dresses and color coordinating. I will be using them for BM dresses and Men's Wearhouse for groomsmen. I might even come back for accessories!\n\nMy only complaint: Their call center was calling me SEVERAL times a day for a few days after I canceled my tentative appointment to come back. I thought it would stop after I didn't answer a few times. Nope. But once you tell them not to call you again, they don't. No issues anymore. But you can't really blame the store itself for that.",,,,,,
-1,"Nightmare.  It's a ghost town. Needles in parking lot. \""Lobby\"" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around. Asked to see our rooms before checking in, given the key, room was filthy.  Saw a sticky note re: bedbugs.  Bolted, as fast as possible.",,,,,,
1,"We stayed here for 3 nights while attending Spring Training.  I have stayed here before and found it pleasant then.  We arrived and check in went smoothly.  We got to our room and were disappointed that there was some type of humming noise non-stop.  We called the front desk and he came up quickly and without hesitation relocated us to another room.  There is plenty of parking and most of it can be found near your room. The pool is nice and very popular with children, so kids noise does abound here.  The breakfast and its staff are great.  Breakfast is included and the main dish changes each day.  The sports bar is very nice and there are many large screen computers for use that are free. Wi-Fi in your room is NOT free.  We ate dinner at the hotel's Belvedere and while the service was not up to par the food was great.  \nI would highly recommend this hotel as it is central to many other locations, airport, Scottsdale, and the various freeway systems.  There is though nothing this hotel, only a gas station within walking distance.  \nYES the chocolate chip cookies are an added touch !",,,,,,

-1,"Oh no, Kabuto.  Went with BF's family for a family celebration.  We had reserved the large room for our group.  When we arrived, we were told by the hostesses to wait to speak with the manager.  The bedraggled manager plodded over and informed us that the room had been mistakenly double-booked and another party had already been seated in the room.  She tried for about 25 seconds to be pleasant and apologetic, but then her willingness to make her customers happy wore thin.  She harumphed and threw her hands in the air while saying, \""We made a mistake.  What do you want us to do?\""  Well, I definitely want you to learn how to act like a professional.\n\nWe declined being seated amongst the party in the large room and took one of the tables in the middle of the dining room.  The place was shabby and the floor was filthy.  I mean, I typically wouldn't notice, because I'm not looking at the floor, but it was noticeably dirty.  The food was average.  The one highlight: the chef was professional, light-hearted and entertaining.  He couldn't save the day, though.  I would not return, and I cannot recommend.",,,,,,
-1,"Six months ago I would've written a glowing review about how Cheuvront is filled with everything amazing.  From their wonderful servers to the beer, the cheeses, the wines, and the food.\n\nThen I came in to have a drink with my brown boy after picking up my man wig for Halloween.  We got there at 3 pm, the place was completely empty.  The bartender mentioned that happy hour started at 4 and gave us the menu to glance at.  Seeing as we had an hour we just had a few beers to start, and to tide us over until happy hour.\n\nThe beer was Papago Orange Blossom (which is glorious!).  Then happy hour rolls around and my friend decides he wants mojitos.  So eventually I get one as the last drink and just asked the server which mojitos they had and I chose the pomegranate one.  The mojitos were good, the mango one tasted like dessert, a little overly sweet.\n\nAgain, everything is cool, until the check arrives.  They charged us the normal $8 for the pomegranate mojito instead of the happy hour price.  I asked the manager and he just gives me a blank stare and tells me it wasn't on the happy hour menu.  I briefly glanced at the happy hour menu and I didn't take inventory of all the items on it.  He decided not to be cool about it and left it on the bill.\n\nI know times are tough around here but when you charge those high prices ($6.50 for a pint?!), and then screw over your customers, absolutely ridiculous.  You lost a long time customer and fan.",,,,,,
-1,"This used to be the Holiday Inn and now it is the Clarion Hotel & Conference Center.  We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. \n\nPersonally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy.",,,,,,
-1,"I'll preface this with the fact that I am biased AGAINST businesses that have limited hours. I work night shift and it is already hard enough to wake up late and do errands in the limited time places are open, to include doctor visits. At least with a doctor I can understand their hours - who is going to go get a surgery at 8pm? Nobody. BUt I do believe that if you have a business that is selling goods to the public that it is good business practice to stay open at least past rush-hour so that people can get off work and come in and shop.\n\nWith that said, I got to Ryan's at 4:32pm after driving from south, southern chandler (south of the Chandler Fashion Mall) and going 10mph on the highway. I walked in 2 minutes after they closed (by my watch) and didn't even think that they would be closed. I zipped into the showroom not even thinking that a pet store would be closing at 4:30 and I had the worker behind the counter yelling at me as I went in, \""excuse me sir, we are closed.\"" No eye contact. No sorry.\n\nI needed one item.\n\nI used to work retail. I know how it is to have that customer come in 1 minute before you close... and 1 minute after you close. I was that supervisor that had to tell them to  hurry up or come back the next day. But I feel that I did it with courtesy and understanding in how I  ran my store and what I could do within reason. I never, ever snapped at someone and just gave them some blanket statement that we were closed and insinuated to leave without even eye contact.\n\nI am pretty sure that I wasn't the only customer there - I could have easily grabbed my item and left before they did. But at the tone that I got... I didn't even want to ask if I could get in and get out.\n\nSo I am lost of what to say. I can't really judge the store itself or the prices... because I barely got past the front door. What I can judge it on is their customer service, their attitude, and their store policy. For this, I give them low rankings. I do understand they have hours that they need to maintain... but they could have at least been nice about it.\n\nFurthermore, there is little-to-no need for me to wreck my schedule just so I can come in and visit their store during their limited business hours. I'll shop elsewhere.",,,,,,
1,"Now while i am not a huge fan of Mexican food...my  wife is and that is why i am reviewing this place...because she sends me to this \""hood\"" on a regular basis. When we were here in June she went twice in the same week and i have already there again since we moved here. She loves the the Burrito enchilada style with green sauce and rice and beans. I promise you when you get this food they put it in a container that keeps it hot for at least 3 hours...and i mean hot people. Now there are only about 5 items on the menu...and i will post those pics as well...and you will see that this Mexican food is expensive.\n\nDespite all of that though there is always a crowd at this neighborhood spot...and you will see people from all walks of life there for lunch every single day. Now noticed i said lunch because they only stay open to about 4pm and then they are ghost folks...LOL. So i have to say if you want authentic Mexican food and don't mind going to the \""hood\"" to get it...it will be the best 8 bucks you ever spent on Mexican food...at least that's what my wife thinks...LOL.

1,"For fresh American faire with a French twist this homey little cottage with hardwood floors will tickle your fancy!  The owner is also the head Chef and the menu changes regularly.  Fresh salads featuring a little fruit and nuts is my favorite aperitif.  Seafood is usually featured, along with chicken, light cream sauces and nicely sized portions that a girl can actually finish.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or girls night out before the theatre, or intimate dinner with another couple.  I believe they now have a liquour license that allows for wine service and maybe more?!  A back room is available for larger groups, call ahead to reserve it.  Reservations recommended, in general.

1,"\""Exotic warm spicey radiantly delicious, everything I tasted got better and better\"" says my wife. We had the chicken tikka masala, the matar paneer, pea pulao (basmati rice) and a garlic & cilantro nan. The portions were generous. We haven't had much Indian (or Pakistani) food before, but just the past week we had some while visiting Sedona, and it's very interesting to see the different styles of preparation.  The masala at Copper Kettle was thicker and I don't think the sauce was spiced as much (as the place in Sedona), the chicken in the masala on the other hand was spiced beautifully (fairly hot).  There was a buffet available (at dinner), but we opted for fresh preparation, and although we waited a little bit for our food, it was worth it.. The staff was very friendly and assisted us with our selection.  We look forward to our next visit!",,,,,,

-1,"Ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.\n\nMy wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.\n After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.\nFour star 4 diamond yea right.",,,,,,
1,Definitely a great nail salon. Ambience was very relaxing and I enjoyed the privacy of getting a pedicure.  The layout of salon made me very comfortable and at ease. The salon's entrance has a barrier which blocks off the rest of the place which gives me that privacy. That way people who are waiting won't be staring. The staff is always friendly whenever I come in. They do great work when it comes to medi and pedi. Highly recommend this place if u want quality work.  Ask for Noon. She is the best.,,,,,,
-1,"This place is absolutely filthy. We were here last year and we decided never to go back but we thought we'd give it another try. Went for dinner tonight and was disgusted. There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights, you can see splatter of food from the last decade. While I was eating, a waitress emptied plates into some bus boy buckets and some fell on the floor and she kicked it under the cart! Tons of garbage and food under these carts. Blech!! Then all the food was cold and hard. Bathroom was a hellhole. No idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way.",,,,,,
1,"Love this spot. Could be the fact that I live around the corner or could be the spot on food. They have 2 happy hours with $5 dollar apps that are enough to keep you full. I always sit downstairs. I call it my \""dungeon\"". Pretty tricky to get up the stairs after a few cocktails, hence the indoor elevator for the tipsy patron. I always order the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped sea scallops. I take dates here and they all love it. We sit by the fire and it's low key. Great place to just sit and be relaxed. If you go early, hard to find a seat (place is very small) and the service is slow sometimes.",,,,,,

-1,"This was the most disappointing BBQ restaurant I have ever been to! From the time I opened the menu and noticed the up selling on items like the sides, and burger items, calling sides regular sides, fancy sides \""in which you pay more,\"" then fancier sides \"" in which you pay even more.\"" These side were basic sides that usually accompany BBQ dishes, and the mac & cheese tasted like Kraft box mac & cheese. My soup was cold and tasted like they just took it from a package and poured it right into a bowl. I told the waitress about the cold soup so she offers to give me a Caesar salad to go, and they poured the dressing on it to send me off with a soggy salad. The brisket was tuff and awful, and the steak was spongy. The most important flaw was that none of their items tasted smoked. Smokey bones is the McDonald's of BBQ with a bar.",,,,,,
1,"We moved here from California and began searching for a pediatric office that would respect of views on raising our children. We asked several friends and this place kept coming up. We made an appointment and headed in. We saw Dr. McClend (I may have spelled that wrong). First the office was incredibly quick to get us in for a well check. Secondly the staff was super friendly. The nurse who too us back was very thorough, very nice. When we got to see the dr she was equally as friendly. She respected our views and never made us feel bad or lecture us about our choices. She addressed our concerns and spoke about a few she had. Our some was a premie, he only gained 8oz in a month so she insisted on formula supplements after nursing. She then have us a formula sample and coupons! Overall we were impressed! We will be bringing our other children to this office as well. The only thing we we're unsure of  is they have a sick and well entrance but they're just across from each other separated by a half wall and fish tank. But it's not a huge deal.",,,,,,
-1,"I don't even know where to begin to point out all the sucks about Macayo's.. they have NO redeeming qualities about them. Greasy chips, tasteless watery salsa and horrible food!\n\nWe ate at this location twice and both times we ordered the mini chimi's which BOTH times came to the table frozen in the middle! Uhg! Most learn from their mistakes, not here.. they make the same mistakes and obviously don't care enough to try to make things right.  Both entree's were served to us at room temperature. Chicken Quesadailla and the Baja Enchilada. \n\nIf you want to have decent Mexican food please, go somewhere else! For this style of food I think I would prefer Carlos O'briens.",,,,,,

-1,"I have a long love-hate, divorced, remarried, divorced relationship with Christopher's. Perhaps it is my overall disgust with the French offerings of late and their seeming laziness of effort in technique, but Christopher's just doesn't cut it anymore.\n\nPaola was always too aggressive on her wine list. Impressive to look at, but a disappointment to order from... sorry, don't have that... sorry, don't have that either. It was always something you just had to get used to, mildly expressing your disappointment and frustration with your server; they'll never get it.\n\nRecently, they've been able to get a super discount on salt. They use it liberally on everything. My last two visits have been such. I have such respect for Christopher and his team, the first time I just grinned and bore it. But this last time, I did send my main course back. What happened to the godly veal reduction? It tastes manufactured... does Shamrock even do a veal stock? I shudder to think. (I flee any building with marks of Shamrock foods.)\n\nMy favorites have been the pastry of snails (escargot), the filet of beef, the mushroom soup, the onion soup, the sautee d'fois gras, the pear salad, and of course the cheese plate. Oh, I almost forgot, the decadent osso bucco and accompanying pile of pasta.\n\nI miss the days when Christopher served a set of 10 tables on the other side of 24th street. Sure, the CD of Chopin Nocturnes played the same track over and over, but the fois gras was to die for and the Bordeaux I had my heart set on was immediately available.\n\nWhat is happening to fine dining in this town? Where else can I go? Please. PLEASE! Tell me.",,,,,,

Order something other than a burger and you don't get much better. \n\nYears ago it might have been worthy of its reputation since there weren't a lot of competitors. Now, forget it.

-1,"Pros:\n- At least there's a climbing gym in this area\n- Walls get reset often\n\nCons:\n- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. \n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\"" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\"" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. \n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. \n- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. \n- The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here.",,,,,,

I do a lot of hiway driving at speeds of 75 mph and started experiencing a bad wobble vibration in front DS wheel. I took it into a repair shop and spent over 350 dollars in repairs. That's when the owner called me to tell me that I was lucky to be alive. After complaining to JB, the offered me 2 oil changes.   I think my life is worth just a bit more that that.

1,"this is one of the best dive bars in phoenix. we go there all the time, and they have hot nuts, and cheap cigarettes, and crazy weirdos like a deaf guy with a giant beard that tried to feel my lady up and ex-hippies and old people.\n\nthey have a pinball machine, and a pool table, and jukebox and a claw machine and a table pac-man and that shooting deer rifle game. unfortunately the darts are a little too awkwardly placed to play. \n\nthe bartenders are amazing and have been there since probably before you were born. the drinks are pretty strong and reasonably priced.\n\nthere is also a sister bar located in sunnyslope which is even sketchier and just as awesome.",,,,,,
1,"If this place wasn't so darn convenient I might never come back. Despite being pissed off EVERY time I come here, I continue to come back again and again.

When we go to the table, it was not ready for us to sit and we had to wait until cleanup was finished. When we eventually got the appetizer the bread, there were no plates around.  10 more minutes to get plates.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, there was only a passing similarity between the menu pictures and what we received.

Pulled into a metered spot, that even had 45 minutes left on it from the last person, THANK YOU!\n\nI recommend either the turkey with provolone on a butter croissant OR the pastrami with swiss on sour dough.

1,"I love Animal Care Hospital. We have two cats and a dog, and they've provided excellent care for all three. One of our cats has been boarded there a few times and I appreciate that I can trust them to take good care of him. \n\nThe dog has gone there after spending the night at the emergency vet and the difference is stark--Animal Care Hospital always makes sure to ease our fears about whatever is going on with our animals and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Well, except for the time the dog got his teeth cleaned and one broken tooth pulled, that cost more than our rent. But still, they did a great job and they made sure that the dog, who is considered senior at age 7, was screened for any complications and I like that they use anesthesia that is considered more safe. (Sorry, I don't really know much about it but they have info in their office about it.)\n\nI do have a pretty strong preference for Dr. Temple vs. Dr. Halver, although they're both wonderful. I think find Dr. Temple to be more engaged and she's extremely willing to answer every single question I have, whereas Dr. Halver isn't always as thorough with my questions. Then again, I ask a ton of questions and he's always provided excellent care, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to friends.\n\nDr. Temple is also a relaxed person, and she's willing to explore all the possibilities and be up front about how much things are going to cost and what's necessary and what can wait until the cheaper treatment option is given a chance to work. \n\nMy only negative is that I have to agree with a previous review about them pushing the expensive Valley Fever test, that's happened to us too and I really don't think it was necessary since the dog didn't have many, if any, symptoms of having it. They didn't use extreme scare tactics but there was some guilt-tripping going on, but for all I know they're just hyper-aware of the perils of dogs getting Valley Fever. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nOne huge bonus for me is that Joyce, who is almost always the one to answer the phones and make our appointments, is incredibly competent and always puts me in a good mood. She seriously makes my day whenever we go in because she does her job well and treats everyone with such respect, and she's as good with animals as she is with people.",,,,,,

-1,Canned green peppers!?! Way too much cheese. The yinzers seem to like it. The average BMI in that place was probably close to 30 and no wonder; the food is incredibly unhealthy.

-1,"After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\n\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\n\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\n\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\n\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \n\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.",,,,,,

1,"What to order: the shredded beef tacos (which is what earns the 4 stars).  I'm a huge fan, my mouth occasionally waters thinking about them (like now).  This is a great spot for cheap authentic Mexican to go food.  This review is more for my friends.  If you're hanging around Roosevelt or Co+Hoots, there is a great easy place to take-out from right in the hood.  Nothing about the overall experience jumps out at me, dining-in sitting in the straight back chairs isn't recommended.  They don't speak much English and the local Mexican families do eat there - so you know it is good and authentic!!!",,,,,,
1,"I'm going to keep this review very short and sweet because until yesterday, I never really felt compelled to yell from the rooftops about Zoe's meals. Especially for my fellow vegetarians.\n\nBut the tides have changed, my friends. Yesterday, because they are close to work and I was starving, I decided to hit up Zoes for the only thing I ever really eat there - the Grilled Pimento cheese on rye which I highly recommend! Sometimes the cheese doesnt melt right and its lumpy but the flavor is divine. No boring grill cheese there. The rye adds a lovely added dimension of grilled-cheesiness.\n\nNow for the new, sexier menu, there are a few more veg options. \n\nI had the hummus and salad plate and I was so surprised at the awesome flavor. The hummus was as good as my homemade hummus and the salad is very well done with real lettuce (no nutritionless iceburg here) and fresh veggies and of course, the requisite Zoe's feta cheese. The cucumber Raita was just the right touch. \n\nSoooooo tasty!\n\nNow I'm not a fan of any of their sides, till now. The Braised white beans are a dream. I dont know what spices they used (ginger maybe?) but I couldnt believe my tastebuds. So proud of Zoe's.\n\nTwo notable changes:\n\n1)There is now a separate charge to grill the Pimento cheese sandwich (10 cents - really????) in addition to the 22 cent price hike.\n\n2) Chips no longer come with the sandwiches but are an extra 65 cents. (cheaper than the vending machine at work still)\n\nEither way, I'm compelled now to patronize this little spot more often. Next time I'm trying the new spinach wraps...mmmm",,,,,,

-1,"We selected this restaurant because we had a gift card to use for our date night and on a Friday, had about a 20 minute wait.  So far, so good.  \n\nOur waitress was really friendly, but not over the top and kept a check on us frequently. \n\nI had an Italian Mojito which I don't recommend, period...blech.  \n\nWe got the Zucchini Friti for an appetizer which was perfect and the dipping sauce was delish and the best part of our whole meal!  I got a salad with ranch dressing - it was fine...nothing special.  I ordered the Carmela's Chicken and it was bland, almost dry and overall just lacking.  I brought more home than I ate and reheated with some garlic sauce I had making it better than the original for lunch the next day.  I wouldn't get it again.  My husband got the steak and had fries that were better than the steak, which I thought was WAY undercooked, even for medium.  Blech!\n\nI would give our waitress an extra .5 half star or maybe even a star, but our food was definitely not over a two star this visit.\n\nGood thing we had a gift card.  We left a nice tip for our waitress with the balance since we had no plans of returning in the near future.",,,,,,
-1,"Breakfast is my favorite meal.  I love to go out and eat as much as i love to cook my own.  when eggs are cooked on a surface  that is too hot, they are done on the outside and undercooked on the inside.  \n\nI belong to a group that meets here every week, after last year, i stopped ordering the eggs because they can not prepare them medium.  so today i ventured out.  i asked out waitress how i should order the eggs if i want the whites cooked and the yolk soft.  she replied \""over medium\"" - perfect.  when my food arrived, i cut into my egg, as it ran all over my plate, the person sitting next to me asked how i could eat them so raw.  \n\nI simply pushed my plate away, finished the meeting, paid my bill.

1,"Choc-a-holics Unite!!  \n\n(Always wanted to say that, hee-hee!)\n\nBut seriously, if you love chocolate like I do, then the Melting Pot is perfect For you!\n\nMP is famous for it's fondue style dinners but for me the star of the show is their desserts! Give me melted chocolate and strawberries and it's ALL GOOD! No seriously....this is my numero uno place for dessert! But I'll get back to that in a moment...\n\nDinner there is more like an experience...first and foremost it will take you at least an hour and a half (depending upon when and what time you go) to get through a typical 4 course dinner (cheese fondue appetizer, salad, main course fondue and of course, dessert). You don't have to have 4 courses but if you're looking to be full going for the full courses will take care of that! (I recommend the fiesta cheese fondue that is custom blended at your table for the appetizer...it's served with blocks of light and dark breads, chucks of cauliflower and carrots and apple slices, YUM!) The main course is chunks of your choice of meats and fish accompanied by several different dipping sauces to try after they are cooked according to your likeness in either hot broth or oil (again your choice of cooking styles)\n\nNOW ON TO DESSERT!\n\nMy fav has got to be the Flaming Turtle..Sounds a Lil suspect I know...but trust me it is fabulous! It's basically milk chocolate, caramel, pecans and a shot of 151 (don't worry its more for show and gets burned off as they light it into the mixture) all melted together to form a little pot of melty chocolate heaven! With this you get strawberries, bananas, pineapples, crushed coconut and Oreo covered marshmallows, chewy fudge brownie bites, and even a Lil slice of cheesecake to dip into your chocolate creation! MY OH MY...every time I get to this part I feel like I'm having an org......OK never mind....let's just say it's over the top DELISH!  ;)\n\nMy only caveat here at this location is the service is hit or miss... granted the servers here have a lot on their plates and probably do much more than the average but I'm sure the tips are making up for this....my last visit a few weeks ago with my hubs for our anniversary was a perfect example...GREAT food...service (and they knew we were celebrating something) was under par (dude was from like Jersey /NY/Boston or something and had that \""ttude..). The hostesses here need an attitude adjustment...all of them...so don't get too put off by them before you get to sit down and experience the fondue....I would give this plae a 4 star because of the bad attitudes that come out of the hostesses on a consistant basis but the dessert is so good it trumps them!\n\nTIP: Call and make a reservation in advance and request a booth with the curtains...it's a little more private and makes you feel like your a Lil more exclusive!  ;D",,,,,,

-1,"I went to Molnar's for a state inspection and an oil change.  I dropped off the car that day.  Later, a mechanic called me to tell my my check engine light was on.  He said it'll cost $99 to do a diagnostic to pull the codes to find out what's wrong (FYI, the actual code reader cost $20 online).  I gave the Ok.  He found two problems and it would have cost another $400 to fix it.  I asked him to just fix one of the two problems since I couldn't afford both.  He seemed a bit annoyed that I wasn't doing both repairs and kept repeating to me that it won't get rid of the engine light.  \n\nThree weeks later, on a Thursday, I came back to get the rest of the problems fix.  The same mechanic said the parts needed to be ordered from the dealership and it will be here Monday at the latest.  He said he'll call me when the parts come in.\n\nOn the following Tuesday, I decided to call him since I haven't heard anything from him.  He told me he didn't put the order through because he forgot.  He told me he had a rough weekend.  Told me that he'll order it right away, and reminded me that it takes a few days like he \""told me before.\""  This time around, he did call me and let me know the parts were in.  He also gave me an estimate that was $100 higher than the previous estimate.  He asked me to bring in my car on a day he's working.  I said that I needed the car by 5pm as I needed the car for work.  He said it was no problem and that I'll be the first car he'll work on when he comes in.  He said he'll put me down for an appointment.\n\nOn the day we agreed, I went to drop off my car.  No one was there yet except for the owner(i think).  I told him I got an appointment to drop off my car for the mechanic to work on.  He looked through his book and didn't see my name and let out an annoyed sigh.  He took my info and I gave him my keys.  I told him I needed the car ASAP.  He replied, \""Yeah, everyone does.\""  At which point, I pointed out that the mechanic said he'll do it ASAP for me.  He just ignored me.\n\nLater that day, I got the call from the mechanic, telling me he ran into a problem.  Stripped bolts were preventing him from removing the part.  Told me he'll have to break surrounding parts to remove it and those surrounding parts will need to be replace because of it.  He said it was too big of a job for him and I should take it to a dealership.  He then added that the dealership ....sent him the wrong parts anyways....\n\nI ended up getting the repair done at the dealership and got my state inspection.  Guess what?  There were no stripped bolts.  No surrounding parts needed to be broken.  I think I was lied to because he ordered the wrong parts and didn't want to be bothered with getting it right.\n\nIn my opinion, Molnar's mechanic and owner are very unorganized.  Their communication skills need serious work, with the customers and between themselves.  I will admit, I had no issues with the oil change and the first repair they did.  But the hassle and the amount of time I spent trying to get repairs done through them wasn't worth the time.  I hate giving a business one-star, but they deserve it.",,,,,,

If you want to hang out for a while they keep filling up your tea (the best way to get in good with me) or if you gotta run, they hook it up. \n\nI think most everyone already knows the Streets of NY menu and the food here lives up.

-1,"My boyfriend and I Pricelined a room for our anniversary trip this weekend. We were super excited to get a \""3.5star plus\"" hotel for a really good deal. It's too bad there were so many things that worked against making this a truly awesome hotel: \n\n- The fact that there is no carpet between the pool and the elevators, so the floor is often dangerously wet. \n- The fact that the bathroom door opened onto the toilet - you had to sidestep it in order to close the door. \n- The fact that the night desk clerk, when counting the register, set the cash tray on the counter nearest the customers. It would have been an easy, quick jaunt out the front door with it.\n- The 20min it took to get extra towels\n- The empty ice bin in the vending area\n- The desk clerk who came out to talk to customers while still chewing food\n\nBy far the worst offense was the fact that check-out time was noon, yet housekeeping tried to enter our room at EIGHT IN THE MORNING. I can't imagine it's that hard to find out which rooms are ready for cleaning, and which are not. \n\nThe only real pro was the bedding, which was luxe and fluffy. Not even close to being worth the $2800 they sell it for, but fun for a night. \n\nThe room ended up being cheap for the name-brand, but more satisfaction could have been found from a lesser-name place. Lesson learned for next time.",,,,,,

The service is great and everyone is friendly.  The food is full of flavor and the portions are perfect; when you sit down you are served croissants and jam before ordering you meal.  When you think it is done your server brings out dessert for your table; it is always great, making the meal and experiance complete and satisfying.",,,,,,

I do all of my lending online and have my book ready and waiting for me when it's available near the front counter so I don't have to venture too far inside.\n\nFor others, you would have to contend with finding parking or riding public transportation. \n\nNot really worth it.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter",,,,,,

1,"Where to start? This place is amazing!!! From the moment you walk in you immediately are immersed in wonderful aromas of a real deal deli. There sandwiches are amazing, its not about the bread, its not about the toppings, its about the meat. And to me that's what makes a great deli sandwich is the meat. Everything I have ordered here is amazing and worth it. From the kielbasa, smoked bacon, and the pork franks, you cant go wrong with what you order. Their deli meat prices are slightly cheaper than your average Boars Head meats you find at the store and are one hundred times better. So grab some cash, stop in ,you will be greeted with a friendly smile and you will be a customer for life, just like me.",,,,,,
-1,"I took my parents out to celebrate the Christmas season.  My mother ordered the petite filet mignon, which she thought was very good.  The sides we ordered - mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, were also good.  However, my father and I shared the porterhouse for two.  For $90, I would have expected a much better piece of meat.  Flavor was good, but It was tough.  There were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife.  In addition, the presentation was poor.  They put a big plate in the center of the table, then cut up the steak into 10 or 12 cubes.  These cubes were then cooked.  I could have done better at home.",,,,,,

-1,"This place would be out of business if it were not located next to 3 hotels and the convention center. It is not completely horrible, but I would recommend walking a few blocks up to Arizona Center complex where they have 3 or 4 different choices.

But if you are on vacation and planning a sit down dinner, don't waste one of your few vaca nights here.",,,,,,

1,"So, I've lived in Tempe all my life, needless to say, TSCU has been there for the majority of it. They have only gotten better since my first savings account started there, back when I was a wee lad. I recently had the pleasure of closing a mortgage with this bank to which I can say 'kudos' to TSCU for helping me buy my first residence. They were super helpful and laid everything out for me in easy terms. The situation was pretty atypical though-- After applying for a lender that bank sometimes uses, it dragged on, and I was very nervous I wasn't going to be able to close on the property. The loan officer I was dealing with, actually went all the way up the ladder to see if she could move the process along. Needless to say, the company they normally used, decided to be buttheads and take forever, so she talked the people in charge and was able to get everything financed in house... Booyah. Now I'm happy owner of a nice little condo. \n\nThis bank is super awesome, they've always been friendly every time I've been in there. As long as you avoid the lunch rush, I've never had to wait more than a minute or two to get to a teller inside. They have 3 drive-thru tellers, so you won't waste any gas sitting and waiting to get helped.",,,,,,
-1,"Just because you have the word Plantation, implying old Southern American charm, in your name doesn't mean you can't provide modern services like clean restrooms? Perhaps you could sweep the floor. And wipe down the counter. Oh, I know, maybe the pigeon poo could be scraped off the tables. I know. I know. I'm asking so much. And you'd think with a sort of Southern American name, you'd have that Blanche Deveroe, drawl and all, southern service, friendly and warm, like a peach cobbler on an autumn afternoon. Sadly, no. If I were to go again, I shall bring my Dustbuster, Lysol and my Miss Manner Guide to Etiquette book (yes, I do have one, quit laughing Kristin and Stevey P.) Rants aside, the coffee was passable. Although the coffee station was messier than the Circle K near the airport. It looked as a group of overly caffenited monkeys had just used it. And the croissant. Was like a pastry boomerang.

-1,"SETTING:\nNice environment that was able to cater to groups of all sizes, from small parties to even an ugly sweater party (this really happened!). Kind of dresses itself up to be a nice sit-down place, but unfortunately, the food was not on the same level.\n\nFOOD:\nFor appetizers, I shared the Calamari with my friend and for the main entree, I got the recommended Pasta Trio. \n\nFirst off, I love calamari. A lot. I've definitely had better at similar quality establishments. The calamari was very bland and did not taste fresh. The batter was not crisp and crunchy. The sauce tasted watered down. The recommended \""Pasta Trio\"" (3 types of pastas and \""all you can eat\"") was a bit below average. For a recommendation, I expected more. Overall, the food was underwhelming. \n\nMy friend always cleans her plate. So clean, that it looks like she was served only the plate. This was the first time that she did not finish her dish (Chicken Cacciatore). She is not super picky, so this really meant she did not like it.\n\nThe type of food here is comparable to Olive Garden in terms of American-Italian fare, but I would rather eat at Olive Garden anyday. OG just tastes better and is way cheaper.\n\nSERVICE:\nMediocre at best. The waters were not kept filled. Not a huge deal for me since I drink slowly, but some of my friends kept looking for the water and it clearly distracted them from their dining experience. The Pasta Trio is \""all you can eat\"" and they come back to refill your plate. A few of us were waiting on the third round...and we never got it. Even though the food was not the tastiest, we were hungry and still needed to be fed. The wait staff didn't even ask if we wanted a third serving, and just took our plates quickly without giving us a chance. A few of us were still left a little bit hungry...it was a grumpy ride home :( \n\nIMPRESSIONS:\nRelative to the pricing of the food, I expected better quality. Even if the pricing was on par with comparable establishments, the quality of the food was lacking. I hate to say this, but we had a disappointing experience overall, from the food to the service.",,,,,,
1,"Having gone to two other LA Fitness locations, I will have to say this place is probably the best LA Fitness in town.  It has improved a lot over the last year in terms of customer service.\n\nMany gyms have the old 1980's model of service where they don't want you to talk to them or ask anything unless it involves a cash transaction.  They do consistently greet with a smile, and up until last year there was more of an issue with them talking to each other or texting instead of working, but I think someone has made it a point to not let them do that.  \n\nDuring busy times, they have one male and one female employee who clean the entiire time...cleaning bathrooms, emptying trash and cleaning equipment.  I appreciate this, as I have been in too many gyms that look like a disaster area during peak hours.\n\nParking is a challenge from 5:30 to 7:30 Monday through Wednesday. Other times and days are much better. \n\nI otherwise have no real issues...lots of equipment, no trauma, no drama.",,,,,,

-1,"I was so excited to eat at Barringtons for my birthday dinner. I'd heard and read so many rave reviews, I was sure it would be amazing. It wasn't. In fact, to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Where to start? We had a reservation for 8 and they even called us to confirm. But when we showed up, they made us wait for 15 minutes and there was nowhere TO wait because the bar was full of other diners in the same position. Waiting for their tables to turn. Pacing wasn't much better after we were seated as we watched our waiter do a series of odd jobs other than wait on tables (never mind ours) for 20 minutes. We only had water and menus. The menu isn't so long that it takes 20 minutes to make a choice. When we finally ordered, the food came quickly, but that was my next disappointment. My shrimp dumplings were only OK, and frankly tasted previously frozen. The halibut main course was a nice but TINY piece if fish, and the sauce flavors were almost too subtle. If I'm going to pay $29 for an entree, I expect more than six or seven bites of food! The highlight of the meal actually was dessert. We had a lemon marscapone cake with blueberry frozen yogurt and candied almonds which was superb! The flavors blended perfectly and the cake was light and moist. \n\nOther than the food lacking that \""fine dining\"" perfection I would have expected, the space itself is awful. It's not \""small/intimate\"" it's \""small/claustrophobic\"" and oppressively loud! The bar was perpetually full to overflowing into the tiny room and the tables are so tiny there's barely room for the plate and beverage. I'm only 5'2\"" and 110lbs and I felt like I was sitting at a child's width table at adult height. It felt more like a chain restaurant's ambiance than a place you go for a special occasion that's for sure! \n\nOn the whole, a major disappointment. Maybe the economy has them packing people at the bar to up drink sales ( and overbooking to do it), maybe we hit an off-night,  I don't know, but I wouldn't go back. I should have gone back to Ratcliffe on the Green instead. That is a fine-dining experience. Barringtons was not.\n\nADDENDUM: I just re-read other reviews and wonder if I even ate at the same restaurant (yes, I know it WAS Barringtons, don't worry, I'm being sarcastic)! There was no four course option where we would get selections chosen by the chef, the chef never made an appearance, it was not quiet and intimate, it was loud, stuffy and decidedly \""suburban,\"" and the fact that people don't seem to mind dropping $150 for salad and pasta, or appetizer and tiny entree is astounding to me when there are such amazing meals to be had in Charlotte for the same or LESS!",,,,,,

My turkey sandwich was dry with no sauce on it, they forgot the avocado and when I finally received it , it was brown.  I let it go  but when my husband bit into his pulled chicken sandwich and almost choked on a 1  1/2 inch bone that was it for me. .. I said something to the waitress and the response was well it is chicken and they have bones and they  pull it off the bone . Are you freaking kidding me.. what the hell kind of response is that?  I am trying to find a way to contact Alice cooper himself because how can someone put their  name on such a disgrace of a establishment.  I would never ever let my restaurant get to that point.

1,"Terrified of hair cuts for years, I decided to take my son to a barber shop. Now he looks forward to his hair cuts and asks to go all the time. Abrahigm is the best. My son refuses to see anyone else. On days that he rides his bike, they let him bring it into the store so it's not parked outside. I have taken him to low cost and high end places, and no one has ever been able to make his hair look nice. I couldn't blame them, he's got enough cowlicks to drive a professional mad, and they've all grumbled after the hour long cut. Abrahigm doesn't take long, and still gives him the hot towel and massage treatment- a place where a boy can be treated like a young man. The search has ended.",,,,,,

The man actually doing the repair emailed me with a cost estimate and had me sign off before they began the work. \n\nThe watch was repaired, but it took much longer than I was promised (almost 6 weeks). In addition, after I got it home and inspected it I noticed it appeared as though they had left it in a cleaning solution for to long.

Egg rolls are tasty as is the egg drop soup.  The meals always come with the traditional hot tea and end with a fortune cookie.\n\nThe atmosphere is old school with booths around the walls and tables within the room.   \n\nIf you are looking for a decent Chinese restaurant with good food and no surprises, you have come to the right place.",,,,,,

1,Green chicken tamale was amazing.  Perfect moisture.  Not to salty.  The kernels of corn added sweetness to it. There was a nice manageable amount of masa. The thing was like crack. Could not get enough.   Also had the\nChicken chile relleno.  Which was amazing tasting..       \n\nThe only downside was being tucked away in a broom closet with three other tables.

1,"What I love most about Welcome Diner is that when you are there, it doesn't feel as though you are in Phoenix.  The menu is good ol' Southern comfort food with a twist; they have Deep Eddy alcohol's and they make amazing homemade lemonade...well it's a little page right out of the South (Austin, TX to be exact).  We need more places like this.  \n\nThey have a vegan po-boy sandwich with fried avocado that I could eat everyday, it's just that good.  They use the freshest veggies, no really, so fresh that it was probably picked that very day from the Garfield community garden.  That's right, fresh AND local.  I also can't get enough of those delicious collard greens!  I was impressed with the staff because they knew exactly what was vegan (right down to which bread I could eat).  Any time I find a staff educated about ingredients, it's a win.  And anytime I have gone with my non-veg friends they rave about the menu as well, so I think it is safe to say that it is all yummy.\n\nAll in all, this place is simply adorable, quaint, fun and delicious.  It is small inside so if you can get in there, I highly recommend it.  The staff is very friendly and attentive which makes for an even better dinning experience.  There are also plenty of seats outside and a to-go window which makes it even easier.  Great place to hang out, meet new people and eat good food!",,,,,,

It's not fancy or pretentious, just a great place to stop in and grab a sub.\n\nMy favorite is the toasted turkey - no frills, just a turkey sub with tomatoes, lettuce and mayo - and don't forget the provolone cheese.  For $7 with chips and a drink you can't go wrong here.  \n\nSub Factory can get a little busy during the week for the lunch crowd, so call in before or come a little after normal lunch hours and you won't wait more than a few minutes.",,,,,,

Place is so crowded, loud and a bit dingy.....Only reason it got 2 stars was because the service was nice and staff was very friendly.",,,,,,

They were both very tasty.\nFor the main course we had the lamb shank and the chilean sea bass. The lamb shank was fall of the bone tender and wonderfully flavorful - the sea bass on sea bean salad was really really good- very well composed and balanced.\nThe desserts were very good too - Hadden liked the peanut butter chocolate the best and I like the Brown Butter Peach. \nGood food, nice intimate but casual setting. This is a definite Phoenix must-try and a great date spot.",,,,,,
1,"Truly impressed! We got fried calamari that was crispy and fresh, stuffed mushrooms were buttery and not too crabby. Between 4 of us, we all shared each other's food. I loved the tortellini the most. Veal was a delicious and a nice cut too. Calamari at dinner was just as yummy, not chewy, and fresh! Shrimp scampi was a hit too! \nEvery meal is served with soup and salad. I believe the dressing and soup changes often. I liked them, didn't love them, but everything is homemade and tastes that way. \nWe ended the night with a nutmegy strawberry cheesecake and the limoncello cake.  I prefer the cake :)\nI left extremely happy and stuffed. \nThis is where you go for good homemade Italian food with love, and waiters that are good at their jobs. It seems other reviewers didn't enjoy themselves, and I would blame their expectations. It IS mom and pop, and it's amazing!",,,,,,

She came up with the awesome idea of getting all crazy and wearing wigs. .....I thought \""FUN\"" and wholeheartedly  agreed !!! ........Now she wants me to keep this wig thing a secret so strictly poker face here. \n\nAfter reviewing Yelp, I told her I had the perfect place to find some cool wigs. I drove us around the block three times, literally . With this little 1970's wig boutique being on Central Ave , it's not exactly easy to access. \n\nFinally, I found a  small  alley and pulled in the back. (please see the picture). I knocked on the door with the microscopic signage that says \""Wigs\"" and out popped a tiny Asian woman who whisked us inside.\n\nWe walked into wig heaven. Every length , every color. I couldn't stop laughing. Rows and rows of wigs. \n\nI was a little startled at how the owner was so protective of her wigs. She made us sit down and only one person at a time could try one on. She  said \"" Are you going to buy a wig today\""? I smiled and said NO..........we are going to buy TWO !!!\n\nAlthough the parking was atrocious ( one star), the service was abrubt and  rushed ( two stars), we ultimately found our perfect wigs for the reasonable price of $35 each the best part,  I'm still cracking up!!! (that's worth five stars in of itself!) Overall, I would rate this shopping experience a  solid five ! \n\nHave a great weekend ! \n\nGaga..........Oh-la-la",,,,,,
-1,"Unbelievably disappointed.  I'm in town for business, and went on a week night.  They were not terribly busy, but as a solo diner, I was treated quite poorly.  Mostly ignored during my meal, I had to get up to chase someone down just for a water refill.  Not once did anyone check on my meal (I would have loved a second glass of wine), which wasn't stellar anyway.  \nI did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that I felt my service was horrible.  Maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service.\nI travel to Madison Wi frequently for work, and I can tell you that they'll not get repeat business from me.",,,,,,
-1,"I would give this eat n park location zero stars if I could. I arrived at 11:15am and was seated quickly but that was about it. My waitress did not come over until 11:41. I did not receive water or any service for 26 minutes.  That is outrageous to me, I've never had anything good to say about this location and will not be visiting again.",,,,,,
1,"You're guaranteed to have a beautiful and eye-opening experience at the Desert Botanical Garden!  I was a little skeptical before coming because, to be honest, I didn't know that Arizona had any gardens (with average summer temps of 105+ degrees, I didn't understand how anything could survive out here), which shows you how sadly Californian I am.  But I was blown away by all of the varieties of cacti, and the gorgeous, surprising colors of desert flora here.  You'll see things you never knew existed, and it's so peaceful and, dare I say, romantic, to be among the cacti?  \n\nThe bf and I had the good fortune to come on a sunny day, and we got to see the butterfly exhibit.  Granted, I'm a little afraid of any type of insect, but this is not to be missed.  Butterflies flitting their wings and kissing all the flowers - adorable!  The Desert Botanical Garden is a must-see if you're visiting Phoenix.",,,,,,

1,Went here a couple of years ago with several families for spring break.  Was thinking at the time that it may not be the best time to visit however we had a wonderful time.\n\nThe hotel itself was very nice and the staff provided excellent service throughout.  The grounds were up kept nicely and the interior was very clean.\n\nThe primary reason we picked this place is due to the fact is that they offered a water park on the premises for the kids.  Well I should have left it for the kids but me being the entertaining dad that I am decided to go on it as well.  I ended up going on the slides several time and the inner kid in me was now out in full.  Little did I know that going down a chute at 800mph and hitting a pool of water would hurt??  I ended up with bruises from my butt down the length of my leg.  OMG!!  Still had fun though but next time I will leave that to the real kids and I will stick to the lazy river.\n\nThe only real issue with this is its location.  It is located right in the city so there really is no break from civilization.  The nice thing though is that you really don't notice it when on the grounds.\n\nA fun trip but I don't know that I would go back.  I would look for something a little more secluded.,,,,,,
-1,"The two stars are bonus points, but it gets the basics wrong.\n\npro: \n- Bright, airy\n- I never need to walk miles to get to the terminal \n- Very cool statues greet people to the Queen City, those always put a smile on my face. \n\ncons: \n- No restaurants or bars available to hang out with family and friends and wait for the (often delayed) departing flight. That's a deal breaker for me. Security checks are here to stay, do something about it. \n\n- TSA agents are often rude and overly aggressive. Yes, compared to other big cities. \n\n- Employing bathroom attendants, News Break: hello, the fifties are over! \n\n- Not enough airlines service Charlotte or compete for its business. \n\n- Not enough direct flights in or out. Unless I want to make the trip 4 hours longer that need be, the only direct flights to London are with USfreakingAirways. For a wannabe INTERNATIONAL HUB that's not too famous.",,,,,,
1,"This theater has it all, great value, cleanliness, and location.\n\nIf Harkins were a big box store, it would be Target, to AMC's Walmart. This location (like all other Harkins) is full of friendly employees, upscale facility, and great movies.\n\nI can't imagine that many people would choose AMC over Harkins, but just in case you need reasons to love Harkins, here are a few.\n\n-Loyalty rewards cup. Purchase this cup once a year, and the rest of the year you get one dollar refills. This is an amazing value! In addition to being green, it's great on your wallet, and really a considerate thing that Harkins does.\n\n-Refill on large and XL popcorn bags. Purchase either LG or XL popcorn bags, and you get one free refill. While it is noted that it needs to be on the same visit, Harkins is nice enough to not enforce that. After you finish your movie, just fold up your popcorn bag and throw it into your empty cup, now you are ready for your next flick.\n\nHarkins is also locally owned, so when you spend your money, more of it stays in AZ, which is great.\n\nOne last tip, if there is ever a line at the box office, just bypass the line, go inside and use one of the little automated machines, and save tons of time.",,,,,,
-1,"We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes, but these just don't taste good.  On top of it all, the coffee was horrible.  \n\nTry DeLuca for a diner experience or Crepe Parisiennes for a good crepe and coffee instead.",,,,,,
-1,Do not trust this days in. Note on wall saying no refund after 15 mins but out of site so you don't see and takes that long to drive around to room walk up stairs and see the state of the room. No refund given. Rude and unprofessional. \n\nThey take your money.  You don't get to see the room. I asked for non smoking. All I got was a smoking room. Went back and changed and got another smokers room. Came back and got shown a sign on the wall to the side\n\nOUT OF SITE TILL THEY SHOW YOU NO REFUND AFTER 15 mins.  Do not trust this days in. They stole my money. The room is not worth 58 bucks. It's not worth 30 bucks. Ramada hotel Charlotte airport and conference center and for 10 bucks more it's like going from a dumpster to a royal palace. \n\nTake my word. Don't waste your time or money.  And if you don't believing me ask if you can see a room before paying. And I bet they will refuse cause the photos look nothing like the rooms.  Trust and go elsewhere. I lost money. No refund and I have to wait till the money hits my bank and then I get it back but as I am leaving the USA. Well that will take time.  So don't take my word. If they don't let you see. Go else where. Why would they say 15 mins lose refund. Simple. It's that bad!!!!!!!!!! Unprofessional when owner says go to hell to a customer asking for refund!!  I won't even give it one star if I could but I have to,,,,,,
-1,"Pastries are nice but I bought a cake for my sisters bridal shower and they PUT THE WORDING ON THE CAKE INCORRECTLY! it was a Saturday and \""could not call a baker in to fix it so they could refund me the cake and just take this one, go somewhere else to buy a new cake, or try to fix the writing ourselves and just remove the word that was INCORRECT.\"" I spent hours on the phone with the manager and she was not very helpful or empathetic to the situation.  \n\nI then went to go pick up another cake for my sister for her husbands birthday and THE CAKE TOPPLED OVER IN THE BOX IN THEIR OWN FRIDGE!  I asked the lady if this happens often and she goes nope your just \""special\"".  Being really rude about it.  They patched the cake up and THEN showed me the cake and THERE WAS A WOODEN STAKE IN THE CAKE to \""keep it together\"".  I then said that there is a hole in the cake now and the counter lady said, \""Just smooth the hole over with your finger a little bit.\"" \n\n\nThe counter girls are always rude.  I honestly think they don't like me because they are nice to everyone else but myself. But if I would suggest I would NOT go here.",,,,,,

-1,"We were disappointed. A client recommended Girasole to us on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. While the food was alright (not spectacular) our waitress was the worst and for some reason, on the warmest day of summer, the a/c was not on. Everyone in our party was schvitzing and trying hard not to ask our waitress to drop the attitude.\n  \nThe food was fine, but again, when the rest of the experience is poor it really doesn't matter how good the food is. We won't be back.",,,,,,
1,"Dearest Abbey, you lose a star because the price for the Ceremony of Loveliness is too high.  Granted you have included tip and tax in the individual price so I don't have to bother w/ the icky math, but $23 seems high for sandwiches, a few savories, scones and some desserts.  Didn't you also use to include fruit?\n\nHowever, you still rock a great tea, the food is good and it is so girly fun to browse and linger...I will keep coming when I want to let my inner maiden out.",,,,,,
1,"We've been taking our three cats to the Animal Care Hospital for a year now. The staff is wonderful and truly loves animals. Dr. Temple is especially great, and although the hospital offers many tests and expensive maintenance procedures, she understands financial constraints, and is kind enough not to guilt you about passing on the $500 echo-cardiogram. She has little tricks to distract the cats while they are getting their shots and offers a number of over-the-counter and inexpensive solutions to try for minor ailments or bad feline habits. They have an on-line \""pet portal\"" service so you can keep track of your pets' records and when boosters are due. The office is always clean, and they have at least 3 doctors, so you can usually get an appointment pretty quickly as well as bring in pets for emergencies.",,,,,,
-1,"I have always heard of this place on tv. I was around the area and decided to check it out. Walking in was not to expectations. It's to dark, dungeony and it has a weird smell and very hot in here. The place highly needs some upgrades and natural light. I was by myself to I sat at the bar. Ordered house margarita... Prices are from $7-16.99 a drink depending on the ounces. The staff is nice but not friendly. The restaurant provides u with chips, salsa and spicy bean dip. I have ordered from the lunch menu and seems a little high priced for a lunch min. 7.99- 12.99 majority is $9.99\n a plate without an al carte option. I had gone to discount tires and obtained a 20% coupon for eating at arrivals since it's right next door.",,,,,,

-1,"My conclusion after dining here for the first time is that hubby and I  have had all of these menu items before- and done better at other restaurants. The chips, carne asada, and carnitas were all sub-par. The rice was pretty good, however, as was the guacamole. The waiter had no clue about what type were the beers listed on the menu. The one shining star was the flan: perfectly smooth and creamy, and one of the best I've ever had. I'll be back for dessert- but ONLY for that.",,,,,,
1,"Love this place. One of the best Korean BBQ restaurants in the Phoenix area. They have excellent service and the private karaoke rooms are a blast, especially if you have a group. Just be aware of the soju, it'll creep up on you.",,,,,,
1,"Went back to this Mac Grill on July 28 for late lunch to see how things are going with the chain's new ownership (Joe's Crab shack parent Ignite versus prior Golden Gate venture firm who was frankly disinterested).  Spent a lot of time talking to Deonne one of the new managers. She and lead manager Renee are highly experienced and dedicated to turn this location's reputation around.  Many (perhaps total) new staff.  There is a different (positive) vibe and these managers want to know if something doesn't meet customer's satisfaction.  A new district manager for all AZ locations is also arriving soon.\n\nOur food was well prepared, large portions, and the service was attentive.  Manager was making the rounds, not hiding somewhere.  Benefited from a buy one, get one entr\u00e9e special and the half price wine promotion.\n\nThere's a revised menu coming mid-August to improve quality and restore some favorites.  I'm told it will be high quality items at affordable prices.\n\nSo for those who enjoyed eating here in years past, but became disappointed since 2008, it's time to give it another try.  But if something isn't to your liking, find the manager and speak up right then and there.",,,,,,
1,"I just love everything about this place. The location, the outside seating, the vibe, the food ... everything.\n\nThe kitchen is very small. This vintage diner car was meant for one cook. So the two guys in there really have to hustle and work around each other. The food is top quality as well. My boyfriend and I split a PB&B Burger and the Bumblebee chicken sandwich on a biscuit. The chicken was probably my favorite, but it was impossible to eat like a lady. It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth, you have to get some on your face. I gave up and just started stabbing at it with my fork. \n\nThe best part of Welcome Diner is the atmosphere: twinkling lights, picnic style seating, and friendly staff. I'm not sure who was working this last Saturday night, but he was so friendly and knowledgeable. We had a good little conversation about the history of the diner car. \n\nThis would be a great date place ... if that's something you're looking for. This is also a good place for a group of around 6 friends to take over a picnic table.",,,,,,
-1,"Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.\n\nOn a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.\n\nShe was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.\n\nShe return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?",,,,,,
-1,"Average food that is way overpriced. For the price the portions were small the taste average and after sitting in the waiting room of a nearby hospital for days we were looking forward to some taste and comfort food. Not!!! old and dirty room, and not good home flavor.",,,,,,
1,"I typically tend to stay away from chain restaurants as often as possible.  I do have to say though, that I have been to several Outback restaurants thoughout the years and honestly I will say, I have never had a bad meal at any of them.  The quality of the steaks are pretty good, and it was cooked to a proper rare, so I can't complain about that.  It has a pretty extensive menu, if steak is not your thing, and I would have no problem going back to an Outback Steakhouse in the future.",,,,,,
-1,"Usually when my friends go on and on about how they love a restaurant, I can't wait to get in and try the food. Our tastes are often a match. \n\nThe first concern I had from the beginning was the fact that there was only one person of Thai descent working and she was slinging the stuff they were selling. \n\nWe open the menu to find reasonably priced fare (a soft spot for my wallet). Many of the dishes you would be accustomed to finding in any Thai restaurant could also be found on the menu here. Since it was my first visit to this establishment, I decided to go safe and ordered the Pad See Iew with Chicken. Once it arrived, I was pleased with the presentation. But in my many years of eating I have learned, just because it look good fo show don't mean it goin' da taste good!! To be fair it wasn't horrible... but I certainly have had better. \n\nThe waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive. Something just seemed a little off about her? I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that was off... but if I do, I'll let you know. Perhaps one thing could have been the fact that a table of 8 came into her section about 15 minutes after we arrived and we seemed to have been just forgotten. \n\nTo sum it up folks... if you are in the area and you want a REAL Thai dish with plenty of kick hit up Thai Hut on McDowell and 1st St. Amazing food served by the people that invented the stuff, and prompt extremely attentive service.",,,,,,
-1,"I know Jimmy John's is all about \""super freaky fast\"" service, but their manners are also pretty freaky.  I'm usually sympathetic to unmotivated or cranky employees (after all, there's nothing glamorous about working at a fast food place).  Unfortunately, the college kids who work here are particularly resentful--and they don't mind taking it out on your sandwich.\n\nI came in by myself to pick up dinner for friends.  When I tried to place my order, the girl working the register (who was obviously new) struggled to punch in each item.  No one seemed interested in helping her, even though 4 other people stood behind the counter.  She finally started yelling at them...still, they just stared blankly at the cold cuts in front of them (maybe they were stoned?).  \n\nAfter they made and wrapped my subs, they placed them on the counter in front of me.  I asked if they could bag them since it would be awkward to carry all those sandwiches on my own.  One employee pointed to a stack of paper bags and told me I could bag them myself, if I wanted.\n\nThe sandwiches are all just variations on a theme: meat of choice, watery mayo, tomatoes, a modest smear of avocado, and too much shredded iceberg lettuce.  The taste is much improved if you add their tasty hot peppers, but I very rarely crave a Jimmy John's sandwich.\n\nFor fast food sandwiches, I vote Subway.  The only benefit of Jimmy John's is that they deliver.",,,,,,
-1,"If I could have given today's experience negative stars, I would have.\n\nThe food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were \""going to need a high chair for that?\"" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.\n\nWe were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.\n\nShe knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.\n\nIn this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.\n\nAnother server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.\n\nWe go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.\n\nAt no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.\n\nI'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.\n\nI guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.",,,,,,
1,"I really like the Katsu Chicken, I have ordered almost everything on the menu here, its that kind of place.  yet I really think the Katsu here is the best.  Large potions and they have authentic drinks.  don't forget to get some Ono Hawaiian sauce that is to the left of the counter.  \n\nHappy eating,\nKevin",,,,,,
1,"My friends and I have been big fans of PCG for well over 10 years, we've never had a negative dining experience.  Some tasty appetizers, great entrees and the specials are pretty delectable.  The staff provides great service, some of them have been around for years.  Love the atmosphere.\n\nOne of my all-time favorite meals was at the PCG, well over a year ago, and I can't get it out of my head.  It was spicy grilled white fish served on andouille and potato hash over grilled sweet corn puree.  The fish was perfectly cooked - steaming hot on the outside and just set up inside, very moist.  The sweet corn and spicy sausage were awesome together, the meal was just incredible.  My friends were envious - I shared a few small bites :)\n\nMy red meat friends praise the steaks and lamb, I love their seafood entrees and the sauteed veggies.  Hearty portion sizes but not over the top.  Still haven't figured out the magic in those mashed potatoes!  I'd try to save a little room to share a dessert, great bread pudding!",,,,,,
-1,"Jack?! What the heck? You weren't on your A-game last night.\n\nI hastily ordered seasoned, curly fries and 3 egg rolls yesterday evening after a rough day at work. Okay, and a cheeseburger. And, Sprite. I had a bad day - don't judge!\n\nI arrived home in Fountain Hills and tore open my grease-splattered, hot bag of treats. My eggrolls were not in the bag but yet I was charged. Grrr - hate when that happens. Drive-thru lady was friendly but needs to double check bag orders to not piss off drive-thru patrons.\n\nPlus my fries tasted like they were sitting in the warmer for awhile. Dry and crunchy. Don't be lazy staff - dump and start again. Please! :)",,,,,,
-1,"I just got back from here and first off, we waited for over an hour for our food. The people who had come in and ordered way after us were served first, which was rude.

Granted, they did take 30% off after we said something, but the food wasn't even that impressive. I'm definitely never going back.",,,,,,
-1,"Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans).",,,,,,

We decided to stop by Roland's Seafood Grill.\n\nWe were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the US open was playing.  Our orders were taken right away then we waited for 30 minutes before our meals came out.  We were glad for the US Open entertainment.\n\nMy dad order the clam chowder soup, which was chunky and bare of any clams.  My mom and I shared a couple of appetizers, the calamari was great but the crab cake was just ok and a bit salty.\n\nService gets 2 stars and Food gets 3 stars.\n\nOverall, this place gets a 2.5 stars.  If you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area, stop by.  I would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area.",,,,,,
1,"Chinese food has become so Americanized that it's easy to forget (or never know) about the flavors and preparation styles that characterize authentic and regionally-specific Chinese food. A few months ago, I had a great experience learning about authentic Sichuan from Helen Y when she invited me to join her at Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center, and this past weekend, she invited my husband and me, along with some other very fortunate Yelpers, including David S B, Jason W, and Alexander C, to eat some more amazing and authentic Chinese at Lao Ching Hing (according to her review, their Chinese menu features mostly Shanghainese food with some Sichuan dishes and a few Cantonese dishes). \n\nJust as at Szechwan Palace, the atmosphere of the restaurant was nothing special. In fact, it was a little messy, at least in the little area with the large round table where they sat us - we were surrounded by all of these rows of boxes and random containers. Oh, well - atmosphere aside, the service was friendly and prompt (our waters were always kept full), and the food was incredible. So that you are able to order some more authentic items, I'll give you a breakdown of what Helen ordered for us off the Chinese menu (which she has so generously translated and posted to the business info section of this review): \n\n*Cold jellyfish in scallion oil - This had a nice semi-chewy texture (reminded me of octupus) and a vinegary sauce. Reminded me of kim chi, which I love. \n*Wok-fried rice cakes - Little oval noodles (same texture as Chow Fun) in a savory light sauce with fresh, crunchy vegetables\n*1/2 crispy duck - Tender meat with crispy skin; served with Hoisin sauce\n*\""Ants Climbing Up a Tree\"" - Unusual name but tasty dish. It was vermicelli (thin noodles) with a minced meat and chili sauce. \n*Whole salt and pepper shrimp - These were crispy and had the perfect amount of salt and pepper coating. The shrimp themselves were a little fishy, though. Highly recommend eating them whole (including the eyes!)\n*Beef tendon and tripe in scallion oil - I wasn't wild about the texture, but the spicy sauce was really savory and flavorful.\n*Soup dumplings - Little dumplings filled with soup broth that you have to eat in one big bite. They were good, but I preferred the ones that we had at Szechwan Palace. \n*Fish pieces w/ sauce - I could be wrong, but I think these were  the \""spicy soybean paste with sliced fish\"" from the menu. They were very bony and difficult to eat, but I enjoyed the flavor. \n*Peking spare ribs - Delicious! Had the most savory sauce and really tender meat. \n*Drunken chicken - Not a huge fan of this dish. The chicken was a bit dry, instead of falling off the bone, and the skin wasn't crispy at all. \n*Chopped Shanghainese greens with tofu in sesame oil  - Served cold. Was really flavorful and light and would be great as a vegetarian appetizer. \n*Sauteed \""snake\"" gourd with soy beans - To the best of my knowledge, this consisted of pieces of sauteed squash with soy beans in a clear, mild sauce. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was the perfect complement. \n*Steamed and deep-fried bun - This came in the shape of a long roll that we had to cut into individual pieces. It was delicious doughy and slightly crispy on the outside and was fabulous dipped in some chili sauce. \n*Green onion pancake - This has always been one of my favorite authentic Chinese dishes and has a wonderful mealy texture. Again, excellent dipped in chili sauce!\n*Deep-fried shredded potato - Being that we went at 11:30 on a Sunday, my eye was drawn to this hash-brown-like dish. Didn't regret my choice because it was delicious. Comprised of undercooked and crunchy potato slices in a sauce with chiles. \n\nOne note - nothing we got was ridiculously spicy, but the chili sauce that comes on the table allows you to spice everything to taste and added flavor (and not just mind-numbing heat) to every dish I tried. \n\n15 dishes! I may have forgotten to mention a dish or two, but as you can see, we had a veritable Shanghai feast! In this day and age, feasts usually cost a pretty penny, but the 9 of us walked out having only spent $20 each. Paying that little money for so much incredible and authentic food is just freaking incredible. I guarantee that my husband and I will be back!",,,,,,
1,"McAlpines is one of those old school places that would probably be right at home in downtown Prescott. Authentic, amazing service, and the whole fact that they have an antique store really helped make this place shine. \n\nWe had a simple dessert that consisted of 2 Phosphorus's and a hot fudge sundae, and after wards, I felt bloated and diabetic. That's because for the prices, you get a surprising amount of deliciousness. You feel like a little kid when your kind, humorous, tattooed server brings you a MASSIVE sundae cup, dripping with hot fudge and all of the toppings. \n\nThe only, and I mean, THE ONLY drawback, is that I live so far away from them. On the other side, I guess that means I won't be gaining 20 pounds anytime soon.",,,,,,
1,"This place was awesome.  You could tell they tried to fancy it up a bit inside, too, which shows interest in appearance.  Appearance matters when working on my clothes!  \n\nFirst made contact via email and the owner responded in very timely manner directly answering my questions.  He was polite.\n\nMade a visit and that woman at the desk was friendly, nice and smiled/laughed with us.  Saying \""thank you\"" to customers is very important.  Why is it that we as customers always end up saying thank you when we pay???  Nothing wrong with that, but shouldn't the clerk say that as well?\n\nClothes and comforter were picked up and, according to my source, everything looked great and was ready when advised!\n\nA little more costly and not close to my location, but worth the drive.  Great job, Park Ave.!",,,,,,
1,"As it turns out, Bandaids is not as bad as any of these reviews indicate and is very rarely as scandalous as these reviewers report. \n\nReal girls: some implants, some without. Some girls with tattoos, some without. Big boobs, small boobs, middling boobs. Big wrecking ball booties, small booties. Male/female/gay/couple friendly. Cheap drinks, strange regulars, ugly signage. The occasional girl that shouldn't be stripping anymore. All in all, a lot of variety under one roof- and isn't that what makes a titty bar entertaining? If you want an army of malnourished blonds with bolt on breasts to stare blankly at you while they take your money, then skedaddle on to Bourbon Street, my friend. \n\nBandaids has personality; you may like that personality or you may not. Depending on your behavior, you could be charmed, chatted up, romanced, shanked, talked shit to or put firmly in your place. So be nice. \n\nBottom line: these girls are lots of fun, but they aren't accustomed to taking shit from anybody. Especially you. :)",,,,,,
-1,"If you want to be treated like garbage at a pretentious overpriced \""whatever\"" of a restaurant then go.  My recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here.  We were greeted rudely when they learned we did not have a reservation.... On a freaking Thursday.... In a college town!  We walked out, so thankfully they did not get our money and we had a wonderful meal just two doors away.",,,,,,
-1,"Went there for lunch Friday.  It was a pretty bad experience.  When we walked up to the hostess stand, she immediately told us to wait a minute and walked off...When we were seated we waited at a long time for service (the restaurant was nearly empty).  A waitress asked us if we had been waited on, and when we told her no, she said \""I wonder if they assigned me this table\"" and walked off.  We finally got a waitress.  After we had our orders taken, we saw her putting out ketchup bottles, etc. on the tables before she even put our orders in or brought us drinks!!!   The service didn't get any better, we waited a long time, and my food sucked.  Kinda hard to criticize a cheeseburger and fries but I didn't finish them.  I would have loved another napkin and had to finish my burger with my knife and fork because I couldn't wipe my hands.   I didn't leave a tip for probably the second time in my life.",,,,,,

If you don't like this then chances are you don't like bacon or good cheese or success or America and I have a problem with you.",,,,,,
-1,The ambiance is cool and the wait staff are friendly....BUT....the menu is tired and the prices are expensive for the quality of food.  Great for a tourist...get you in there one time...but for a native like myself....there are too many great places in walking distance for them to compete with.  They really need to shake up the menu and audit their pricing.,,,,,,

Seriously it was chunks of leathery meat swimming (really) in gross brown syrupy sauce. With several pathetic pieces of onions. Thats it, folks. Thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong.  This is not chinese food. No, this should not even be food.",,,,,,

I shop at this Goodwill a few times a month because I live nearby in South Arcadia. I'm always looking for bargains and things I might be able to use in my classroom.\n\nThe only negative so far happened on my last visit when some guy feverishly kept straightening the books and videos while I was browsing through them. He was always near me and in my way. I didn't know if he worked there or just wanted to, but I let him do his thing to avoid the drama.\n\nTeachers get a 25% discount on Sundays if you show your school id...oh...and seniors (55+) get the same discount on Tuesdays.",,,,,,

1,"My friends and I had an hour to kill before the Elite Great Gatsby Yelp Event. So after a stop at the sex shop down the street, which is a whole other story, we stopped in here for a drink. Now I am not a coffee person at all. Not even close. The closest I will get to coffee is a frappuccino which is nowhere near coffee which is why I like it. I was looking over the menu looking for anything I might like and noticed they had Italian Soda. Hey that sounds good. The woman behind the counter, who was very nice, realized that we were newbies so she explained how things worked. Basically you can get any flavor you want in any drink you want. So I settled on a peppermint Italian Soda. The prices I noticed were very cheap for a coffee place. I was expecting smaller sizes for that price but no I ordered a medium and it was pretty big. Much bigger than I expected. Plus with 10% off for checking in it was great.\nOnce I placed my order my drink was made very quickly and with a great attitude. It tasted great. Cool and refreshing and it hit the spot.\nAfter looking over the other reviews I wonder if I went to the same place because I had a great experience and would go back again if I was ever in that neighborhood. Maybe I went on a good day or they have straighten things out or something. But for the price and the taste of my drink I would definitely recommend it.",,,,,,
-1,"We were not impressed at all. We took the time to sit down with one of their accountants and explained exactly what we needed them to do for our businesses. Spent at least an hour and a half going thru everything and provided them with all the information they needed. They told us they understood and sold us on their services - but clearly they either didn't understand or were incapable of doing anything that didn't fit into their rigid structure. A quarter later we called to follow up and we got a \""I'm too busy for you right now\"" reply. Not cool. Three months after that we realized they weren't doing anything we asked and we tried to find out what happened. Instead of owning up to their mistake - they tossed insults at us and acted like our earlier conversation never happened! When we took our complaint to the owner we got a very robotic apology with no attempt to make things better. Clearly this company doesn't work well with others.",,,,,,

And less sale items.",,,,,,
-1,I have eaten here several times only because it it right around the corner from my house. The sushi was good the first time we ate there and has been down hill ever since.

-1,Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back,,,,,,
1,"Yum! We had a mail coupon for buy one entree get one free, so figured what the hell and gave this place a try. \nIt's located in a strip mall, but certainly doesn't feel like it when you are inside. It has quite authentic decorating, is clean, and VERY welcoming. It feels like being in a family restaurant with a cozy feel in Mexico. We were seated instantly. We had the best service here I have EVER had. Not exaggerating. Jovan was our server and was amazingly fast, efficient, friendly, and motivated. Our drinks were always full, food was out in a flash and just how we had ordered it. He was amazing. Always smiling- all of the customers appeared content and relaxed.\nOnto the food here- spectacular! It seemed quite authentic. It was hot, great flavoring, and the menu is large and diverse. They give chips with 3 types of salsa that were all very different, but wonderful. I saw quite a few people order the \""fajitas for 2\"", which were huge and presented well. \nI really highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner. Comforting feel and absolutely perfect service. \nI have still been raving about it.",,,,,,
-1,"Wow. Just was refused service because we had a large group. When we offered to break up and just sit with the family. Nope....not an option. Empty restaurant, and they would not let 18 people sit and eat. Their policy  is \"" no teams\"".  We had 6 high school girls and 12 parents.  The hostess politely  said they have had teams cause problems.  Well, this policy just cost them. None of these 12 parents will ever return. So I can't tell you how the food is. Just don't walk in as a large group. That is my tip.",,,,,,

1,"Bought my first Road bike here.  a sexy little red dress number.  Everyone who knows me knows I'm more of a little black dress number as black is slimming. But I couldn't resist the apple red and white, and the price was awesome, as they offered me a clearance price for the 2011 without any prompting on my part.\n \n3 bike dudes helped me out;  A younger guy with a beard gave me the initial  discount.  Because I bought the bike right before closing time, I forgot to get fitted, as I spent the last few minutes joy riding on my new sexy steed.  \nSo I called and went back the next day; Mountain-biker Mark spent tons of time with me finding the right accessories and adjusting my bike;  what a sweet, patient cool dude, I highly recommend the ladies seek out this man for bike education and service.  \n \nThe prices are competitive and pretty decent;  I compared, researched and checked, and that was what finally won me over for my last minute impulse buy;  We women do a lot of last minute impulse buys....\n  \n  And the Slippery Pig guys will go out of their way to make a lady feel, well, bike-educated, and they will tell you like it is, which I appreciate.  It might take a wee little bit of time for them to warm up to you, so ask for Mark.  He's my go to bike guy.  \n \non a side note:  this store is dog friendly, which is really a plus in my book;  expect dogs to sniff your butt and lick your legs (...and more)...while you browse.  Eli and his his Cally are adorable....",,,,,,

-1,"Me and my family were in Charlotte for my Sorority's conference and we decided to go to Mert's for our last night in Charlotte. The wait wasn't bad and they accommodated for a party of 9 which was also nice because most small restaurants would just seat you at different tables. We did not think the food lived up to the hype...at all. Lemonade...not freshly squeezed, even though the server said everything is made in house and fresh. Cornbread and Soul Roll...best part of the meal. Anything fried....TOO GREASY. I got fried catfish and my plate was covered in grease and whenever my fork went into the fish, more grease would spill out...EW! One food runner, female, came to our table with the wrong food. After no one claimed the wrong food she says, \""Do yall even know what you ordered?!\"".....ummm CLEARLY you just have the wrong food. Let's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal. Someone in the kitchen needs to change the oil, drain the food with a napkin (simple) and avoid getting grease on the entire plate. The yams tasted like they were drenched in maple syrup...and that's it....not good at all. My moms cooks better soul food.",,,,,,
1,"A SOLID 4\n\nThe first encounter with SP was when they were located on central and camelback, and it wasn't good. Yet my second time was 100% better.\n\nI went it for a carbon fiber fork, and they called around some stores to find them. I was more than slightly impressed.\n\nThe only odd thing was they orginally offered me a used carbon fiber fork, then later offered me a NEW carbon fork for a $100 more...so I said \""no thanks.\"" With my surprise they told me I could have the new fork only $20 more than the used fork. It was a cannon dale carbon six..so for only 2o dollars more was a bargain i could not pass up. Odd that he tried to hike me up...I mean I would have done the same thing...but he was a little bit to obvious. I would have been insulted if I cared enough. \n\nI will go back for my repair needs foooorrr sure!\n\nR\\_",,,,,,

-1,"This review is focused on the framing department. \nI have a wonderfully talented daughter who has given me a number of beautiful drawings that need to be framed. Today I headed off to Michaels to try to get one of them framed. The picture was rather large so it doesn't fit in a standard mat/frame without some effort. The guy that helped me was fairly helpful, but the prices were ridiculous! Even with a \""supposed\"" sale of 55% off and a single mat...the best he could do was still well over $100. Well, that didn't work for me. He gave no other options to me either. Instead I headed to Hobby Lobby, where they had a frame on the sales floor that I could use (about $22 with my coupon) and had a lovely lady help me with a custom mat. They put it all together for me and I'm out the door at $42. Guess where I'm going with the next picture???",,,,,,

-1,"Eat n Park is usually decent.  This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.  Seriously, we never wait less than 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, and we live near the Waterfront, so we've given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times.  Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  It's not.  Doesn't matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.  Today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a \""closed\"" section.  That server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  I've never had this issue at any other EnP.  We left, drove to the Squirrel Hill location, and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the Waterfront.  Mgmt- you have a beautiful, prime location.  Get your hosts and servers on the same page!",,,,,,
-1,Mostly staff is great (Candida is the best).  Prices are DEPLORABLE.  Compare prices between EMAH and other Vets before making the decision to make this place your primary vet.  I Guarantee you that they will try to nickle and dime you for EVERYTHING if you let them.  Not ethical in my books.,,,,,,
1,"This place is pretty good.  I mean, getting my car washed isn't exactly a chore I look forward to completing... I usually view it as a \""time suck\"" in the middle of an errand-filled Saturday.  \n\nWhat I like about this Cobblestone location is that you can really multi-task!  The inside is loaded with extras, including a Dunkin Donuts outlet (the rest of my errands are more productive after I get a coffee boost).  There's also ample indoor seating with CNN and sports, and a huge kids' play area a la McDonalds -- which I imagine is very convenient if you have family in-tow.  \n\nThe quality of the car washes is average, but this is my car wash of choice when it comes to spending time waiting.\n\nTIP:  do not use cash for the exterior-only fast pass lane unless you have exact bills!  If you insert a $20, the machine will give you a receipt and force you to go inside the store to get your change -- which completely defeats the purpose of \""fast pass.\""",,,,,,

I ordered the roasted spring vegetables and the baby back ribs. The chef completely doused the veggies in vinegar and they were extremely sour. The ribs were a little too dry. \n\nWhile eating my ribs, the waitress came over and explained how I could eat them.  ? Not really sure why this happened. \n\nI won't be going back.

They even have a special workout area for women here so girls don't have to feel creeped out by dudes checking them out, which I know is a big complaint for most women at gyms. I want to give it 5 stars, but the gym is really busy at the start of the week, and most weekdays it can be a little difficult to find a parking space, but that's not exactly something Golds could improve upon but worth mentioning. For $15/mo you can't lose.",,,,,,
-1,"Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.",,,,,,
1,"Just moved into neighborhood and found this restaurant on yelp. We were greeted immediately by friendly staff and we belief owners were working.

1,"Whenever I feel too land-locked and forget what the ocean looks like, I head off to Islands.  Maybe it has something to do with the freaky-tiki kind of decor, or the surf videos that play constantly.  I Like It Here.  Yes, it is a chain.  Yes, it is smack in the middle of the Desert Ridge Marketplace.  No, I don't care.\n\nIslands restaurants are everywhere in So Cal, and they are all consistently good for a casual meal.  I was happy to see that there is a location in Desert Ridge - nice and close to me!  The service is friendly and attentive - you aren't left panting for a drink refill.  My faves are the North Shore tacos and the Sandpiper chicken breast sandwich.  If you are in the mood for some bad for you goodness, definitely try the cheddar fries.  A plate laden with their fresh-cut fries just covered with cheddar cheese and chives.  Served with ranch dressing, it is artery-hardening perfection.  Who needs a fork!?  Just use your fingers!!",,,,,,
1,"Had a Groupon for this place, and I'm glad I went. Although the sides were okay, the ribs were just how I like them, tender and not quite falling off the bone. The sauce was good and plenty of it.

-1,"I really wanted to like Cheuvront--the idea of having an urbane spot in which to explore a wide range of wines and uncommon cheeses was very appealing.  If I had stuck with that I might have had a very different experience.  Unfortunately, I tried to range farther afield and came away feeling like everything except the wine and cheese came from Costco.\nCheuvront gets predictably high marks for the range of the wine list and the varieties of cheeses--if Wallace and Gromit decided to move to the desert and become social drinkers, here is where they would do it.  I took the menu's advice and paired a Queso Iberico cheese plate with a pinot noir (Cartlidge & Browne '07) and liked both very much.  Actually, I liked the cheese.  The rest of the \""plate\""--almonds, dried cranberries, and a few grapes in their twilight years--evoked no real response at all.  My accomplice in dining chose the Pascual Toso Malbec '07 (accurately described as a full-bodied red) and summer salad.  The wine was great--complex and dry without being acerbic--but the salad tasted like the chef had just given two weeks' notice.  The chicken was bland, the \""mixed field greens\"" had clearly just come out of a bag, and the roasted shallot white balsamic vinaigrette was the middle school marching band of dressings: yes, I recognized what was being attempted but still felt bullied by it.  The pumpkin bread pudding was good, but not worth making a trip for.  The latte and cappuccino were fine, but here's a tip for the kitchen: if you want coffee to stay hot, warm the cup first.  By the time our friendly-yet-overwhelmed server came back with the cinnamon, the drinks were lukewarm.  \nSpeaking of service, let's not.  We got menus, we got food, we got the bill.  We also waited a lot, heard several rationalizations for said waiting times, and had to repeat requests.  We spent two hours for a snack-sized meal that required no cooking except for the bread pudding that had obviously been made much earlier.\nIf I could send one message to Mr. Cheuvront, it would be this: It doesn't require any particular talent to sell good wine and good cheese at above-average prices.  It does, however, require talent and skill and desire to create an experience that keeps folks coming back.  If I want to drink good wine in a mediocre setting, I'll buy a bottle at AJ's and smuggle it into Denny's.",,,,,,
-1,"If you get the chicken club you're okay otherwise  stay away from pretty much anything else but the salads.   We were there tonight and got the food in a somewhat timely fashion the waitress hostess however would not seat us until our entire party of 12 arrived otherwise she would in \""get in trouble\"" Which was ridiculous so we had to wait around and not able to sit down.    Then, one person in our party didn't get her chicken sandwich until about 10 minutes later and then got charged an extra dollar for it to be blackened but it wasn't blackened and the manager told her no when she tried to take the dollar off how crazy is that?  I can't believe this place has been around so long and is still in business with such poor management.  Unfortunately this is the only restaurant on the lake and they know it.  Such a shame they should really get their act together.",,,,,,

-1,"In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.\n\nThe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.",,,,,,
1,"Back when I lived in Phoenix this was one of the only places I bothered with eating at. Started by a Chicagoan who moved to Phoenix, they get deep dish right and make just about everything else in the style of delicious. I was in town last week to hike the Grand Canyon and stopped in. Man, I miss their food. Thank God I live in Chicago and can get something similar! Be warned though. Their food is BIG.",,,,,,
1,If you are in the market for stationary or custom invitations this is the place... recently I had to get some invitations made for an engagement party I was hosting.  Being none artistic and a guy I was pretty intimidated... but Lydia was a great help... she understood what I was looking for and was able to get in and out in about 20 minutes and send me a proof within 48 hours.  Great customer service... but you also pay for it.,,,,,,
-1,"After being raided several times by Arpaio's posse, apparently Arpaio started hooking them up with tent city work furlough workers. \n\nI made a huge mistake of getting my oil changed there. Halfway into the change I asked them if they replace the oil filter (I shouldn't have assumed), he said no, but he JUST MIGHT have a matching oil filter that he could install for $30 bucks. What? He then tries to upsell me on an air filter, saying oil filter and air filter costs $150, but for me he'd do it for $100. I have no doubt in my mind this guy was going to try and pocket the cash.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague.",,,,,,

-1,"I'm not sure I can even give this place one star. To be fair, the room we had was clean and comfortable. It did seem as if we had entered a time warp, though. Furnishings and bedding from the 70's...if not 60's! I've seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites. I'd like to know their qualifications!!\nWhen you first approach the hotel, it looks closed down. (And write obviously, it should be!!) You enter through a side entrance with hand written signs. The\""office\"" is a room right inside the doors. The hallway looks a wreck! (Oh yeah...they're under construction!!) Dirt, filth, and stains everywhere. Electrical wires exposed, smoke detectors hanging down. You look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes?? (Or are they?!? Hmmmm)\nLike I said...the room was better..although not without faults. The lights over the bathroom sink did not work, and the shower did not work well. The tv was definitely a 1980's model. Wireless internet?? What a joke!! \nWhen we reported the bathroom issues, they said they would move us to another room. Since we were only staying 2 nights, we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning. We were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow!! (Our ever??)\nWe told the lady working the \""front desk\"" that this hotel was pretty scary. Her reply was, \"" yeah, we get that a lot!\""",,,,,,
1,First time here and I couldn't be happier. Great recommendations without being pushy about sales. Quick in and out service and super friendly guys. A+ service and experience!,,,,,,
1,Great spot for tires.. The waits are long always busy week days and weekends everytime i drive by but definitely worth it..I love the fact they price match ..Keep that in mind when shopping around... They also have the best selection of tires around at some the lowest prices.. My go to place for tires.,,,,,,
-1,"The margaritas which Macayos calls \""the best in Phoenix\"" are not. That's the nicest way I can say it. Just don't waste your money on them. \n\nThe food is decent but bland. The guacamole was excellent. \n\nProblem is that any good Mexican food joint that can't give me a good margarita is OFF the list.\n\nThe server was decent but they only had about half the service staff they needed.",,,,,,
-1,"Walgreens has become a travesty of retail. During my most recent visit for a pack of gum and a bottle of water, I waited in line for nearly 10-minutes and watched two cashiers swap registers no fewer than 4 times, and I have no idea why. \n\nThe gentleman with his wife in front of me said, \""This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at a store, ever.\"" And I couldn't have agreed more.\n\nWhen it came time for me to check-out, my total came to $3.16, and I was asked if I was a member of their rewards club, followed by \""why not\"" followed by, \""why not join? it's free!\"" \n\nWhen I declined, and opted to pay in cash, the guy took my $4 and then didn't give me any change. He wished me \""well\"" and when I asked for my change, he looked at me like I was crazy... I reminded him that I paid $4 for a $3.16 item. He then said, \""Oh, did you want your change?\""\n\nUgh.",,,,,,
-1,"Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.

I went during the CIAA the gratuity was 20%.  \nA grilled chicken sandwich cost me $11.00 (overpriced), the taste was substandard and no seasoning.  I guess you can say we recieved third quality food at high end prices. It was terrible.  The the service was okay and I was atmosphere was not that great.  I do not see myself returning.",,,,,,
1,"I really don't know why people are complaining about this apartment complex - it is BY FAR the best place I have lived where I rented from a company rather than a tenant. I have been here almost 1.5+ years and I can say that I really enjoy it. Here are the upsides to this place:\n\n1. My APS bill is always low. I know the old reviews stated that this place leaked cool air during the summer and warm air during the winter, and it was something I was REALLY concerned about because I've had APS charge me $300 for an 800 sq ft apartment before because of bad window/wall insulation. I have never had a bill be more than $90, even in the peak of the summer or winter seasons for 1100 sq ft. Additionally, I never hear anything from my neighbors unless it's a REALLY loud tv, which can be annoying but I can fall asleep to it better than sex noises in thin-walled apt complexes. O.o\n\n2. Greystar took over the complex from Equity Residential, which I was sad about because I don't particularly like Greystar as they are monopolizing everything. HOWEVER, the people in the office remained the same and so did our leases, which I am VERY grateful for; the people in the office are the nicest leasing agents/managers I have ever talked to. They have been flexible in time of financial struggle for me (I had a few people give me minimal notice to leave so I had to cover rent myself) and are always genuinely concerned about what's going on for me. They also take constructive criticism well.\n\nAdditionally Greystar renovated the entire place - apt units, gym, clubhouse, etc. While I opted out of the renovation since I was living in my current unit when they started the renovations, this means other apts have been updated but mine is not. The only downside of this is that the apts are now fetching more than before and switching to a 1-bdrm actually means that I would pay more for less space. :/ This is unfortunate because I have been having issues finding a roommate since my last one ditched me.\n\n3. They actually got recycling bins when I thought most apt complexes don't care about the earth, etc. I am very excited about this new addition.\n\n4. They maintain the property well; it never looks disheveled or gross, and there are always maintenance people around when you need them. Rick, the amazing maintenance guy who has been with the place the entire time I have, is really nice and will fix anything within 24 hrs then leave you a cute note letting you know he was there.\n\n5. I feel safe here. I know that the gates aren't the best and that people can squeeze through them without having a card or having to phone someone in, but I have not seen any crime being committed in this complex which is rare considering most complexes have a loon or two. They also send out newsletters with tips on how to be safe and keep your apt safe around the holidays with the peak theft season.\n\n6. They have these cute community evens like wine and cheese night, pizza night, etc. where you can meet your neighbors and get to know people around the complex. This definitely helps to build a safety net - knowing your neighbors means if any break-ins etc. happen, you have someone indirectly watching over your place. I have never had something this awesome happen at a place I lived at, the best they could usually do was put out stale cookies and warm tap water.\n\nI can go on but I will stop here. :)",,,,,,
-1,"Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10,000 for $6 at Costco)... but I hate this place. \n\nI break out in hives every time I think about having to go here... So then why do I go here, you may ask. The same reason as everyone else. The same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews... to save a little bit of money.\n\nI come here for almost the same thing every time. Diet Coke, allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast. Those are my three go-to items. Every few months there's the toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent... blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.\n\nWhy do I hate it so...? \n\nPretty much for the same reason I have a deep disdain for Walmart. It's chaos. And in true Walmart fashion, I actually saw someone wearing their pajamas here the other day. \n\nPeople walk around here lulled into some kind of trance by price savings and free samples. It's maddening. In the parking lot, in the store... waiting to turn INTO the parking lot... people are crazy. They completely stop paying attention to what's going on around them. I've been touched inappropriately by shopping carts, nearly run into by cars. It's insanity. \n\nOh and by the way, speaking of parking lots... why the hell aren't there more cart return areas. I think I've seen two... It's generally a game of, can I find a spot to hide this cart, or should I just walk it to the front of the store. \n\nAnother thing: A lot of people talk about the great fuel savings... I've never purchased fuel here. Wanna know why? Because every time I come here, the line for fuel is no less than 3 cars deep per lane! No thanks. I'll pay 10 cents more per gallon somewhere else. \n\nAs I sit here typing... anxiety level rising, I wonder to myself... are the savings really worth it? And for now, sadly, the answer is yes. But one day... One Day Costco! I will be free.",,,,,,
-1,"I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the \""chain\"" expectation. \n\nI order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.\n\nFortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. \n\nI'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day.",,,,,,

1,"Everyone has a project they've bookmarked and thought about doing. Come here and grab some supplies, and actually do it this weekend. Why not? \n\nInside is nothing short of an upholsterous meshacopia of bargain fabrics canoodling with high-brow silks and leathers. \n\nThey have stretchy. Stripey. Fluffy. Fuzzy. Silks, ribbons, lace... even hot pink satin for that classy-flavored Quince\u00f1era dress you've been threatening to make. \n\nBins full of broken button families torn asunder and separated forever. Good luck finding a match.\n\nI enjoy their boxes of .25 scarves, stacks of interesting felty sheets, and counters full of things that would creep me out to find anywhere else (bin full of tiny plastic naked infants, anyone?)\n\nAll in all, this is a great little place. \n\nP.S. In case of emergency, wear your Sunday best as their air conditioning rarely works well and you risk falling dead of heat stroke. \n\nP.P.S. If you forget your Sunday best, call me.

-1,"This is about the one near Hilldale.  Awful. No stars.\n I guess we should have taken our clues form the emptiness of the restaurant and the fact happy our lasted until closing....\nThe margarita was a sickly peach color and was solid in the pitcher.\nThe plates were served with the thumb of a dirty oven mitt in the food (I'm guessing they came out of the microwave).\nThe enchiladas were slimy and water-logged covered in a dilute, flavorless \""mole\"" (i wouldn't call it that.\nThe rice was instant and without any seasoning, not even salt,  with a couple bits of also favor less corn.  The waiter did one of those disinterested \""howseverythinggoingeverythingokay\"" before we flagged him back to say it was inedible. We declined his offer to make it again and just received a bill for the margaritas that we also left.\nOn the way, when we commented on how gross the food looked as well as tasted, another dinner confirmed she would never go there again.\nSo we went across the road to Pascals and had real margaritas and excellent enchiladas with Mole.\nStay away!",,,,,,
1,"You know you are getting good Mexican food when the restaurant's main dish is Pozole. This dish little known to the non-Mexican population is such a staple, along Mole, of authentic Mexican food. Those who know me are aware of how hard I am to please when it comes to Mexican food in the United States, however, this place is going on my must visit restaurants next time am in Phoenix. The service is excellent, the price could not be better and the spices they use give their dishes an authentic Mexican flavor that is hard to find in the US. Our waitress, Monica, was awesome. A little off the beaten path, but, worth the trip.",,,,,,

The chicken sandwhich tasted like it had been left out a while before it was cooked...definitely not fresh!\nTheir mashed potatos were good although they served it with sausage gravy which was unique. \nThe cost was ok. Typical chicken place. The (women's) restroom wasn't cleaned very well and neither was the restaurant. Trying to find a clean table was not hard... only one amongst several messy tables. \nThe only plus to the restaurant was the servers. They had smiles and treated us well. \nIt was the first Bojangles I've been to and I was not impressed in the least.,,,,,,

We started going to Stratum when my daughter was having her 9th birthday, and last year we took my daughter's entire court (from her quinceanera) to Stratum for some laser tag fun.\n\nThe prices are fair.  I usually spend a little more than I would like, but you do pay for the quality.  The food is actually pretty good, much better than Peter Piper Pizza or other places where you have fun, food, and games.  \n\nThe service is outstanding, comparable to Dave and Buster's which is much more expensive.  It is nice to know that you have a clean place, with servers, and someone coming in to help serve and clean up.  We usually had our parties in our home, so it was nice to come out and have people help serve and clean while you sit around and relax!\n\nIt is a great place to come for some decent food and lots of fun for kids of all ages.",,,,,,

-1,"This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\n\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave.",,,,,,

-1,"How does this place have good reviews? I have apartments and Kirch is the only game in town when it comes to used appliances which keeps me coming back; but I'm annoyed I did every time. \nI have purchased 2 refurbished coin op washers here, both died in less than a year. \nI have purchased about 8 stoves or refrigerators, each time they try to charge to remove the old one. Each time I refuse and they always take it for free, because they are going to fix and sell it.  \nI called them recently for a stove repair. I told the guy on the phone exactly what the error code is. They made an appointment to come fix it; they did not fix it and instead just told me the error code. Duh, that's why I called and that's what I told you. First the guy said they would have to order the part and come back. Then a day later some other guy called claiming the manufacturer recommends not repairing when this part is needed.  It's a $50 part and they are flat out lying hoping to sell me a used stove while taking one back to the shop at the same time.  I've had enough, the difference between a used stove/fridge/washer and a new one is not enough to put up with these good old boys - just go to Sears or someone like that.",,,,,,
-1,"This is a nice store: lots of great brands and selection.  Prices reflect the good brands -- don't expect a bargain. The real downside for me as a plus-sized shopper is that they don't carry anything for women in plus-sizes and have a very limited selection of men's things 2x.  I was also hoping that as a surplus store they'd carry more gear. They have some, but very limited in type and variety. The focus here is on clothing.",,,,,,
1,"Finally made our way out to check out the hype.  Parking was bananas and the line was out the door!  We were disoriented when we arrived, as it isn't your usual set up.  As a family of five with a stroller and a baby, it was definitely a tight squeeze maneuvering around.  Luckily, the staff was pretty friendly and could tell we had no idea where we were going or what we were doing.  We had the weekend specials: Steak Hash and Chilaquiles which were delicious!  I originally ordered the Quiche, but they came and flagged me down after I paid to tell me that they actually ran out.  The woman I spoke with was very sweet and made some recommendations, and gladly switched my order for something more expensive without having me pay the difference.  The kids devoured their Avocado Pizza and loved their Mango & Lola Espresso Gelatos afterwards.  All in all a good experience and will most likely make the trek out again soon.",,,,,,
1,"Christos is a family-owned Italian restaurant that has been around for more than 30 years. Given that it is still crowded for lunch and dinner most days, that says a lot. Whether we visit for lunch or dinner, we are NEVER disappointed. They have a great Caesar salad, and a variety of moderately-priced pastas.  It's a quiet, dignified place with a great wait staff, so conversation is possible.  Our dining companions are always satisfied.  It's a very traditional place, so if that suits you, there is much to enjoy here.",,,,,,
-1,"Lunch at Honey Bears BBQ today. Arrived at 11:15 with four parties seated and three in line in front of me - good sign. \n\nI ordered the BBQ pork, hot link, a side of slaw and a drink. He changed it to the # 1 value meal to save me money but it still came to $10.28. \n\nMeal arrived in about 4 minutes and everything was hot but I was disappointed in most of it. Come slaw first: slaw was tangy, perfect spice and mayo level. Definitely would order again. \n\nThe pork and link came together in a HB bun. I got 2-3 ounces of pork and a three-inch link. Decent flavor but for $10, I should get more than 2-3 oz.\n\nThe link was good. It had good snap, excellent spice but just not much of it. \nThe meal came with a pint of BBQ sauce which was unexpected. The sauce had a slight amount of spice but was so sweet I couldn't put much on the Sammie. I suppose when you're called Honey BBQ, you make sweet sauce. \n\nAround the corner is Hap's BBQ which I thought was better but Famous Dave's blows them both out with flavor and value.",,,,,,
-1,"I ordered the hot turkey sandwich.  I should have asked exactly what kind of turkey they used (do they roast their own, turkey breast, etc.) It shows up and looks like the cook ran over to the market and picked up a package of Carl Buddig turkey, plopped it on some white bread and tossed some gravy on it.  I tried to eat it, but I could make that happen.  I called my server over and asked her for something else.  I ordered the ground sirloin plate. Basically the same thing as the turkey sandwich except there was a hamburger patty covered in gravy, mashed potatoes covered in gravy, a bowl of peas, salad and a piece of corn bread.  It was tolerable.  \n\nI suggested to the server that maybe they should get some real turkey and bump up the price a bit to make the plate a bit more appetizing.  As for the hamburger patty, could it kill them to have some ground beef in the fridge and make up a handmade patty instead of using a puny hamburger patty?\n\nThe place has some interesting food advertisements on the wall touting their excellent this and their fabulous that.  Perhaps Jerry should reevaluate what is being pushed on to the customers and perhaps the place would be a bit busier.\n\nI'm wondering how breakfast is?",,,,,,
-1,"I've been here quite a few times since i started working uptown. I usually get the sesame chicken and rice, which is just okay at best. However, today, I got the chicken and broccoli with rice and it was just bad. The chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy. It's too bad, they have a great location and everyone who works there is very nice, but the food is borderline awful. Today was definitely my last visit.",,,,,,
1,"You have to do this. If you are reading this that means you are thinking about it. Stop thinking. Do it. Impossibly romantic this Scottsdale hideaway is understated, intimate and refined. Curving walkways through bougainvillea and honeysuckle camouflage casitas and villas all with private terraces. The rooms are Mediterranean Spanish with fireplaces and comfortable sitting chairs at the base of the massive bed. Go for the designer casitas. No two are alike. They are all amazing. The entire resort is filled with nooks and crannies where you can find solitude and luxuriate with a cocktail while you soak in the scented breezes and warm sun. It's like a private residence you have to yourself with a few others. The service is over the top good. Room service twice a day including turn-down with ice buckets and spring water. Need your car? Make one call and it's waiting at the entrance. The spa is small but you have it to yourself. Steam room, jacuzzi, massage. Do it again before martinis and a fabulous meal at T. Cooks, the on-site four star restaurant. In short, for a three day romantic getaway, there is no place I'd rather be than the Royal Palms.",,,,,,

-1,"I was so excited to order from here, due to the (mostly) positive reviews. Boy, was I disappointed! First of all, we ordered for delivery tonight, on New Year's Eve. Hey, I get it; NYE is a busy holiday for restaurants, so it's not like I expect a 30 minute delivery time. But when an hour and a half passed without our food, we called to check in. They told us, \""Sorry, we only have one delivery driver for more than 30 orders.\"" Um... ok? Why, when you know it's a holiday, would you not staff more drivers? So that was ridiculous right off the bat. Then, our food arrived (about an hour and 45 minutes after we ordered), and I would have forgiven the long wait had the food been amazing (or even good!). Sadly, this was not the case. I ordered the children's chicken fried rice for my kids, and I was honestly scared to give it to them when I opened the container and saw the cold, gray, limp chicken lying within the rice. My kids tried it and promptly spit it out. My order (the cashew chicken) was limp and spongy; the only slightly passable thing we ordered was the General Tso's chicken. Although even that, while it had excellent flavor on the breading and sauce, provided way more gristle than I expect to ingest when eating from a restaurant. \n\nSo we may (if all other options are exhausted) give it another try, because hey, maybe it was just a fluke bad experience because of New Year's Eve. But I highly doubt we'll make our way there any time soon. I'd rather just get Chinese takeout from Imperial Garden on the east side of Madison; it's about the same distance from us as Panda Garden, and it's ten times better.",,,,,,
1,"My husband and I went here last night for dinner. So amazing! The biscuits and dinner rolls were very delicious too. My husband got the chicken fried steak and I got chicken fried chicken. We both liked mine more, but his was good. The mashed potatoes and gravy are delicious and smothered in gravy...yum! We left room for pecan pie which was very good too. Left with lots to eat today for lunch. Our server Helena was great! Very warm and sweet...the place was very welcoming and homey. Will go back! Great comfort food!",,,,,,
-1,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years now and it's become my favorite restaurant. This location, however, is my least favorite. I went in for dinner one night and had Michelle C as a server and it just seemed like she was in a bad mood and didn't want to be there that night. I'll take my business elsewhere thank you.",,,,,,
1,"As a lover of Italian food and an even bigger lover of not leaving my house, I decided to give this place a try! As a first impression, I think it went pretty well, and I'm looking forward to my next experience with this place. I ordered the Lasagna and an order of mozzarella sticks. My review:\n\nMenu/Ease of Ordering: 5/5 Used GrubHub and everything went pretty well. They have a pretty large variety of options here also, which is always appreciated.\n\nDelivery: 4/5 I ordered at around 7:40PM and I had an estimated time of 8:40-8:50, which is pretty standard for a delivery place. I received my order at around 8:30PM, so a little ahead of schedule. The food was nice and warm still, which is sometimes hard to do with pasta dishes. The lasagna came in a nice foil container, helping retain the heat, the stix in the standard styrofoam container. My only complaint was that some of the sauce from the lasagna leaked out onto the plastic bag and then the styrofoam from the sticks and the napkins they included. Mildly annoying, but forgivable. \n\nLasagna: 4/5 Pretty decent lasagna. I've had better, I've had worse. This lasagna has quite the variety of meats: sausage, beef meatballs, and ham. I've never had ham in lasagna before, but I honestly couldn't taste it in particular in this dish. I'm not a fan of sausage, and it was quite flavorful here. Which, if you're a fan of, I'm sure you'd love. The meatballs tasted nice. Quite cheesy with a decent amount of extra sauce. I don't know if I'd order this again, but it quelled my craving for lasagna.\n\nMozzarella Sticks: 3/5 Eh, these were just okay. They gave you an ample amount of them, but they just weren't all that great. 7 or 8 sticks and some marinara. They clearly tasted frozen and didn't have too much flavor to them. I will not order these again. \n\nAll in all, a pretty decent experience.",,,,,,
1,"Good food, attentive service, great ambiance. Hip but not unwelcoming to middle-agers like me. It was a little more pricey than I was expecting but the food is locally-grown. The \""Carolina\"" BBQ sauce on the pulled pork is mustard-based. Pretty good but not what I (or most people familiar with the typical Carolina red sauce) would have expected. Maybe the mustard-based sauce is more common in SC. Hamburger and lemon meringue pie were yummy. All around pretty good.",,,,,,
-1,"Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!",,,,,,
-1,"I'm so over T-Bones.\n\nI used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year, treating myself to their yummy grilled chicken salad or wings--the only 2 things on their menu that I liked.  I was even willing to tolerate the funky smell of the main restaurant on my way out to the deck.  But the last 3 times I've been to T-Bones, the food and service have been awful.  And they changed the menu, removing the grilled chicken breast salad that I liked.  The sweet tea was almost as clear as water, and painfully sweet--undrinkable.\n\nI'm sorry, T-Bones.  We tried to make it work, but it takes two.  Please stop relying on the fact that you're the only place (I know of) in the area where you can eat the water's edge.  It's just not enough to keep us coming anymore.  You actually have to serve good food and decent drinks.",,,,,,

1,"Bossman has been whining ever since Shogun Express on Camelback closed a few years ago. Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! \n\nWe had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!\n\nI picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot! \n\nP.S. They accept Visa & Mastercard, but not AmEx or Discover.",,,,,,
1,"We have been going to Scottsdale in April for the last 20 years for the Scottsdale Culinary Festival. About 10 years ago the consierge at our hotel recommended Aunt Chilada's for great Mexican food. We have been going back for lunch ever since. We fly into Phoenix, have lunch at Aunt Chilada's, then drive to Scottsdale. We always look forward to their great salsa and chips, especially the flour chips. Last year I ordered my regular taco salad and was very disappointed when it no longer came in a flour tortilla shell. My new favorites are the fish tacos and chile rellenos off of the lunch menu.\nThis place doesn't necessarily have the best mexican food in the country but the outdoor dining, pleasant atmosphere, and very cold beer on a hot day, always hits the spot.",,,,,,
-1,"In 1980 this place was outdated. And nobody's changed anything since. The food was totally bland, took forever to get to us, and my hamburger bun was dripping of grease, as if it had been floating in it all day. I was totally displeased with this place. The only reason this review isn't one star is because I didn't see any roaches.",,,,,,

I purchased a pitcher and approximately five bottles of beer over the course of two hours.  My tab was $12.50.  Twelve dollars and fifty cents.  Five stars. \n\nOh, minus one star for getting stared down by a few scary biker dudes.",,,,,,
1,"concur all previous positive notes.  We had our cat in last year for work and both the staff and the doctor are excellent.  I would recommend that you use the services or if out of your range, with his knowledge of area Vets, I 'm sure they will recommend someone.  My only previous dealins with other Vets was negative.  This group really clearly loves and cares for animals.",,,,,,
1,"Not far from the airport, and a great way to start and end your trip to Phoenix. If you live here, better food than the 'upscale' joints in Scottsdale. The seafood is as good as any I've had in many trips to Mexico, and reminds me of a hidden gem an understanding cab driver took me to on a back street near the Sheraton in Puerto Vallerta, and have never been able to find since. You'll know you're here when you spot those casually hung 'Best Mexican Seafood' awards as you enter.\n\nStart of with one of their many varieties of Ceviche, available in three different sized portions. My son liked it so much he had one as an appetizer, and another larger one as his main course.\n\nMy brother then had Grilled Octopus - very tasty and tender. I ordered the Fish Grilled in Garlic Sauce. Amazingly fresh, and done (not overdone) just right. Both platters came with  rice. beans, salad, and under the fish - French Fries! Not at all soggy. And the warm tortillas and spicy salsa let you build a few tacos along the way.\n\nWe washed everything down with several Mexican beers, at  4 bucks a bottle, the same as they charge for for 'domestic' beer (although domestic here would probably be Mexican). Friendly waitress and patrons, and even though we were the only gringos in the place, we felt right at home.\n\nThe three meals, as above, with tax, tip and beers came out to only about $70. You could drive down to the actual San Carlos Bay through Tuscon and Nogales in a couple of hours, but why bother when it's really right here.",,,,,,
-1,"Why do I come here? Every time I do I promise myself it will be the last time. Went in got lunch today around 12:40. There were 6 tables including ours. It took over 5 minutes to get water on the table. We ordered a gyoza, a tootsie roll and a spicy tuna roll. It took an additional 30 mins for that to come out. Our waiter was rude and short with us, hardly came to the table at all. I didn't try the spicy tuna because I'm 9.5 months pregnant but my sister couldn't even choke it down because the fish tasted bad. We had to scarf our food down because my sister had to return to work. We didn't  anticipate it taking 40 minutes for two sushi rolls and some fried dumplings. It would have been one thing if it was busy, but it wasn't. And every time I come here the service gets worse. Seriously moto, this is the last time!",,,,,,
1,"You know how everyone has that go-to place to take visiting friends and other out-of-town guests...this is mine.  I've taken my sister and her boyfriend, my cousin and her boyfriend, several other couples, and they've always LOVED this restaurant.\n\nLocated in an unassuming little stripmall on Camelback (because creative contemporary architecture no longer exists in Arizona), the Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe is so tucked away, you'd never know it existed.  Even if you did, you'd never know it was so damn good.\n\nAny how, a friend introduced me, and I am in love with this place for the following reasons:\n\n1. QUALITY.\nThe food is ALWAYS excellent.  I've never had anything bad here and it's always fresh and tasty.  \n\n2. VARIETY.\nMy boyfriend and I love this place because he can get REAL Chinese and I don't have to eat forture cookies and water.  The theme is noodles, so we encompass all Asian varieties and Italian as well.  They also have other Asian options such as a Japanese bento-box, sushi, edemame, etc.  It's weird that they come to your table with bread and they latter on you're eating tempura...but that's the appeal.  Great desserts too!\n\n3. AMBIANCE.\nI always describe it as Tokyo Disneyland.  It's like a Japanese take on European provincial.  There's a nice brick facade inside, nice fixtures, big, solid-hunk-of wood rustic tables, filagree metal light fixtures, etc.  It's just pleasant and romantic.\n\n4. STAFF\nThey've got that perky-Japanese thing down, even the non-Asian wait staff.  They're always smiling and helpful.  The girls are cute and perky. They're always just really nice people.\n\nSo, come to the Cherry Blossom.  You can bring out-of-town friends and maybe convince them that that Valley isn't all Mexican or big-box/chain places.  \n\nBTW, since the place is small and intimate, small double-dating size groups are good, but this is no place for massive groups.",,,,,,

-1,"Not impressed by this restaurant.  Ordered the pasta trio, which was recommended by the waitress and was labeled on the menu as \""all you can eat\"".  The staff service gave small portions of each and hardly returned for further portions.  If I wanted \""all you can eat\"" I would have been at the restaurant all night waiting to be served.  The pasta was cold when served.  The frozen pasta from my son's school fundraiser was better.  I would not recommend nor would I ever return.",,,,,,
-1,"I was underwhelmed with our dining experience. We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\n\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. \n\nI might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere.",,,,,,
-1,"If you're gonna be one of the ERTOS, at least be consistent.\n\nWhether its a Robertos, Roybertos or Bertoberto- one thing I like is that they all kinda taste the same and I can go to any and expect the same thing. I didn't get that at Rolbertos.\n\nI ordered the carne asada burrito and super nachos. The burrito tortilla was dry and had a flour-y residue on it. While it was a good sized burrito, the what seemed like day old guacamole just ruined it for me.\n\nOn to the super nachos. When I opened the box, the yellow melted cheese atop the mound of meat was just begging to be devoured. I couldn't make it wait so I dove it. Bad idea. Where are all the chips?!?!\n\nIt was buried underneath all the toppings and I couldn't grab anything. So I said... FORK IT! The chips were soggy and no crunch to any of them at all. For the first time, there were more meat and toppings on this than chips. \n\nNow we all know that despite which 24 hr taco shop you go to, the proof is in the hot sauce. And... a hit.. and it was just okay. I've had better and it could be spicier. \n\nThis does not live up the ERTO legacy at all. My $11 could have been better spent at Taco Bell tonight.",,,,,,

The final draw was when I stood there at the counter for 20min with other customer behind me waiting while I got to listen to. \""You know\"" \""Oh my god\"" \""She didn't\"". \""really, really\"" \""Oh my god\"" \""He hooked up with who\"". The girl working the cash register would look over at me and the others waiting and roll here eyes as she kept on talking with the barista.... When she did take my order she got it wrong. This is basically what I got for service for weeks, so I don't chalk this up to a single rotten apple.",,,,,,

DUH (plus the place was not even busy)\nThey did accommodate us after my request to put 2 tables together.\nWe ordered a few appetizers to start...one of them being the mozzarella and tomatoes, we ordered the big portion and asked for the red peppers addition as usual. The order came to the table with 3 small slices of mozzarella and banana peppers. I again had to request a correction. I don't mind paying restaurant markups...but come on a few tomatoes and the paltry amount of cheese for like 9 bucks...shame on you.\nWhen the entrees came the runner looks at us like make room. Of course the table was full because the the app and salad courses had not been cleared.\nGoing to a restaurant should not be about correcting step by step...it should be about having relaxing and fun time.\nThere are many good choices in Charlotte, unfortunately Mama Ricottas looks like it may no longer be one of them.",,,,,,

This is a family business and it shows in great service and concern for customers' satisfaction.   It is a friendly, no pressure store.  Jon the owner seems always available to answer questions.  Every repair issue was resolved no fuss fixed that same day in store or they provide us a loaner.  The musical instrument tutors at Harmony House were wonderful with my boy and reasonably priced.   The store encompasses several sections of an older strip mall.  There is a guitar/strings area, piano sales - instrument rental area and one with sectioned booths for individual tutoring.  The antique/collectables area is currently being eliminated to create a larger performance area, so items there are 60% off.  (aug. 2014)",,,,,,
1,"While I didn't get the authentic Vincent Southwestern French experience (they offer a limited menu in summer...the waiter explained that their regular menu is too wintery and heavy for the summer season), I am still glad I finally made it to this Valley fine dining establishment. We opted for their special \""Julia & Julia\"" $35 3-course prix fixe menu, a great value at a restaurant where entrees alone typically run $35. All but one of the dishes were Julia Child recipes, while the one that wasn't was a dish Chef Vincent cooked for Julia Child many years ago. The dishes were very classic French fare, and all were exceptional. And their croissants...oh my! I could've eaten 10 of them! The service at Vincent's is professional and friendly, if not always the most prompt, while the dining room is Old World elegant (think French Cottage dishes and a player piano). If you've never tried Vincent's or haven't been in a while, I highly recommend taking advantage of this great deal while you can (this August only!).",,,,,,

-1,"Buyers beware! I have been to this DQ several times with minimal complaint. It is small and seating is limited but that never really bothered me. Today I brought my daughter and we purchased ice cream and food and the cashier told me the bill total was $8.00 even. I gave him my credit card and he ran it. At first I didn't think he was going to give me a receipt. I guess they just have a slow credit card machine.  He finally handed me the credit card receipt, not the actual receipt the cash register produces and I noticed that the card had been swiped for $10.00. At first I thought maybe there was a fee for using a credit/debit card and next I thought, wow, that's ridiculous. When he delivered the food, I asked him why the bill was $8 and the receipt showed my card had been charged $10 and he said, \""oh\"" and walked back the register and instantly popped the drawer open, took out $2 and ripped the receipt off and walked over to me. He showed me the total and said, \""you were right\"" and handed me the $2. Umm....ok. So basically, my advice is to watch your receipts very closely, ask for both copies, the credit card and the register one, and maybe even pay with cash cuz last time I checked the 8 and the 10 weren't \""next to each other\"" on a keyboard and I am not sure there's a plausible excuse for this accidentally happening. I am thinking that that employee thinks he's running some kind of scam where he skims a couple bucks off every credit card transaction and pockets the extra money at the end of the day and that's some bullsh*t. I will be contacting the store directly tomorrow to voice my concerns with their manager although maybe he or she's in on it too. Might be best to avoid this location unless you're actually wanting give your money away to dishonest people.",,,,,,
1,"Consistently satisfying. You know it's going to be good when the tortilla chips (1st basket comp., nominal charge for add'l.) are delivererd too hot to touch at first, lightly salted, with 2 choices, red or green salsa. The combo plates are generously portioned, flavorful, perfectly-balanced, complex in seasoning, comfort food. STRONG margaritas. Watch out! Never get \""adverse side effects\"" from eating Mexican food here. A little pricey, but worth it.

From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah.

And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.\n\nSo Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.\n\n(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have \""judged a book by its cover,\"" since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)\n\nSo I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.\n\nEasy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.\n\nIt was salad time. \n\nNow if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.\n\nIs Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)\n\nI'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)\n\nAnybody want to join my one woman campaign?",,,,,,
-1,"People at front desk are not friendly, borderline rude. Its a \""historic hotel\"" but mostly just no attention to detail as far as cleanliness and finesse. Rope-esk shower head mount (not the piping) is at a whooping 5'5 (could be relocated with no plumbing cost). Exhaust fan in restroom has no removalable top and had about 3\"" of dust. \n\nGave 2 stars because the pool deck (level 3) and Thai restaurant downstairs are great, otherwise would be a 1 star. For $189/night x 10 nights I was disappointed, if Palomar would have been available this would have never even occurred, needed something within walking distance of work for the week (2 blocks away).",,,,,,
-1,"My old man always said if you wanted to get rich you'd buy a Texan for what he was worth and sell him for what he thought he was worth. That about summarizes my feelings about TexAZ Grill. This is the most overrated place I've been to in a while. \n\nI'd never been to TexAZ before today because I always seem to crave chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the place doesn't open until 11:00 a.m. Well, today I was craving chicken fried steak for lunch, so I thought I'd try out TexAZ out. \n\nThe size of the chicken fried steak is enormous, there's no denying that; but that's where the goodness ends. Sometimes quantity has a quality all its own, but not here. Let's face it: chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy. Even though the TexAZ steak was big enough to feed four hungry lumberjacks, they really skimped on the gravy. Even worse, both the gravy and the steak were bland, without a hint of identifiable spice. I kept eying the numerous condiments on the table while wondering if maybe adding them to the meal would make it easier to eat. The sides that accompanied the meal let me down too. The biscuit is more like a roll, and didn't flake as a biscuit should; the corn seemed like it might have come right out of a can; and I don't remember much about my mashed potatoes. \n\nIn summary: \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" In fact, I enjoy the chicken fried steak at the JB's on 19th Ave. and Missouri more than the one here. I won't be returning.",,,,,,
-1,"this place is lots of hype with no actual show.\n\ni'm a big fan of the sushi happy hour, and if you are too, don't go here. their happy hour menu consists of like 5 rolls. which are you average run-of-the-mill sushi rolls, nothing special (spicy tuna, caterpillar, blah poo roll). they were extremely cheap though, something like 3 dollars for 8 pieces. and when they arrived at the table, i could see why. they're seriously no bigger than quarters. pathetic sushi, really. the drink specials were nothing to gawk about either, $1 off certain drinks. they have a very limited beer selection as well. i'd rather have walked next door to delux and gotten some good draft hefe, but i craved sushi.\n\nzen32 disappoints.",,,,,,
1,"I heart neighborhood cafes. Thus, before i went I liked it. We tried to go a couple of times and couldn't get in without a crazy wait. Finally, around Vday I made a reservation and we went (although when we went they didn't have our reservation written down...but they made it work). \n\nOur waitor was really nice and just the right level of attentiveness. The food was really good (but not anything unique or out of this world). But quality nonetheless. The menu was a little limited. But typical bougie-cafe selections with a couple twists. Wine was good. \n\nA little pricey. But I also kind of feel like if I can walk to the place, it's locally owned, and it's a reused space (i.e. an old home)...I can spend a little more.",,,,,,
1,I have to mention...the customers who come here are chatty and slow.  A lot if them dont decision their financial needs quickly and need a lot of hand holding which slows down the line BUT the tellers are super nice amd patient. WE LOVE CESAR,,,,,,
1,"I have been coming to Ritos since whn they 1st opened.  I know a couple of the family members.  Although I don't go often, it is hands down the best place to get anything green.  It's alittle hot for me so I always get it mixed with their delicious beans.  Whn I get it enchilada style(almost always) it's so big and filling, u don't need any sides with it.  But the rice is also very good.  Now the meat they use is big chunks and very tender and the green chili has so much flavor but it is spicy hot for me.  Now I have eaten in a lot of Mexican restaurants trying to get that same taste from other green chili burros and in different states( NM, CA and Texas) but there is no comparison and there \""enchilada style\"" is like no other and I doubt u will ever find it like tht anywhere.  It's the cheese,  it's almost like a good pizza combined with the tasty red sauce.  I have tasted some of the other dishes like the tacos which are very good but I wish those were bigger.  I just crave more.  Thts why I always go back to the green burro enchilada style.  It fills u up and it's damn good.  And they finally went plastic.  I have been waiting for that to happen for years making Pete's Fish & Chips the last place tht only takes cash. Lol.  So go eat at Ritos and experience this place for yourself.",,,,,,
-1,"Wow! Worst experience ever! I am sick to my stomach that a company can have ALL,of their employees be so rude. They are disorganized, my driver tonight tried to get in a verbal fight with me over my address.. WHERE I LIVE. He slammed on the breaks in the middle of the intersection, and demanded I,pay him then. Then when I called the company about the incident, they conveniently had no record of me calling for the cab in the first place. I wouldn't recommend them to,my worst enemy. Horrible.",,,,,,
-1,This place is the absolute worst. I would much rather go to best buy or use amazon. Every time I go in their I either don't get helped or the staff scoffs at me and act like I don't know what I am doing. I may be young but that doesn't mean I don't know how to use a camera or that I don't know when I'm being ripped off. Stay away from this store. I really wanted to support a local camera shop but they make it impossible for me to do so.,,,,,,
1,"We have been members for almost two years ago and we love this zoo. It's just big enough that there is always new stuff to see, but it's not so overwhelming like some larger zoos. We just had my son's birthday party there and the hostess was fantastic and the ramada was lovely, right next to the lake. The kids had a great time. Occasionally we receive absolutely TERRIBLE customer service, employees who bark at us or are extremely unhelpful. But most of the staff is first-rate. Would highly recommend for a birthday party, just beware you have to lug everything in yourselves, so have a wagon!",,,,,,
-1,"This airport was pretty cool. Until... Going through that TSA x-ray scanning and pat down! This service should have included four star dining and drinks before hand. \n\nBefore I head back to the West Coast, I was craving for some Bojangles Chicken. Luckily I had a two hour gap before my flight. I was walking from terminal A to terminal B. I literally had walk a mile and a half to get to the only Bojangles in the airport. \n\nP.S. - CLT please add at least one Bojangles in each terminal. Thank you.",,,,,,

-1,This was my third time and probably last . The service was terrible. No particular server assigned so therefore no one to check on us. Our dirty dishes from lunch were still on the table when ice cream soda dessert arrived. \n\nI guess management did not anticipate being busy the Sunday during memorial weekend.,,,,,,
1,"An unusual combination of Asian and seafood/Italian pasta, but it works!  Small, cramped restaurant which apparently is always busy - which I can understand. This is a small neighborhood restaurant, which has been around for quite a while. But the service was pretty good considering the crowd. I did have to ask a few times for water, and one person in our group had to wait longer for her entree than the rest of us. \n\nBut, oh my, the food was DELICIOUS!  I had the Cajun soft shell crab appetizer, and the Calamari/Garlic/Anchovy/Marinara pasta, both were yummy. I also had a taste of my friend's Nabeyaki Udon noodle soup - full flavored, full of mixed seafood.\n\nI finished with the blueberry cheesecake - not your typical cheesecake, it was a baked cake with layers of cheese, graham crackers, and blueberries, topped with a bit of whipped cream.  I will DEFINITELY be going back.",,,,,,
-1,"I walk on a Sat morning at 11am for a retouch on my ombre hair. I had it blonde already and the lady first told me to wait I did. She then came back got me started put foils on which I think she wasn't going to do bec my hair was already light. I show her a picture and ask her if thats how it was going to look a few times and she keep telling me yes. Long story short after3hrs or so she remove the foils and wash my hair put some treatment on it and left me there(for another 30-45mins). I got tired of waiting for her and wash my hair and I also blow dry my own hair bec she was busy with 2 other ladies. My hair was horrible YELLOW AND FRY so burn, uneven tones of yellow/orange/black and red when all I wanted was a caramel ombre. I was so mad but I still just pay her after 6+hrs all I wanted was to go home so I had no energy for arguing. I did told her I didn't like it and that it was too yellow she just said it looks pretty and continue on checking me out. I do not recomment Rachel or the location on 16th st at all. I when the next day with the intention of looking for the owner so I when to the other location on 15th ave and Camelback Lorraine was awesome she immediatley address me and apologize, did a color correction. She fix my hair it look exactly how I wanted. She was really nice/caring and ask what I wanted and not wanted. She was also super fast and did my hair in about 2hrs or less. I really recomment Lorraine at the Camelback location. She also didn't charge me for the correction she just apologize for the incovenience and gave me a treatment to fix my brittle dry hair.",,,,,,
1,"I love this place.\n\nThe food is the greatest, the service is always great and there's just something about the place that makes it feel like you're at a family friend's. \n\nGo here. If nothing else to see the tweens breaking their backs trying to carry their oversized bass guitars into the nearby music lessons studio. There's also a massage parlor that's always open a few doors down. I'd imagine it's not a very classy establishment. \n\nRegardless, try the crab angels with the beef with peppers.",,,,,,
1,Well I want to start off by saying that fudds really does make a great burger. With that being said I found out that they also do a footlong chili cheese dog that is awesome too. Can't forget that they serve that awesome cheese in the pump! Where else would anyone find that? Add as much condiments as you want and make the burger yours! This location is always busy but the employees ( from the times I've been here ) always seem to be very pleasant to deal with.,,,,,,
-1,"This place is just ok. We went here on Saturday, simply because we had a gift card. We aren't usually chain restaurant people, but someone in my family gave us a gift card.\n\nWe each ordered a glass of wine and decided to split the 11 oz sirloin steak with loaded potatoe. I'm so glad we split it. Definitely enough for two people (and my husband is an eater too!). Good steak, well seasoned. Side was good too. Nothing special but good.\n\nJust some things I noted that were kinda off:\n-We didn't say anything about this cause in the end, we didn't care that much. However, they seated us at the booth that shares the wall with the kitchen/server station area. It was pretty loud.....and there were servers standing like 3 feet from us chatting....and dishes banging. At one point, someone in the kitchen dropped a crap ton of silverwear. It was so loud, I jumped out of my seat haha. Pretty distracting. I mentioned to my husband that if we were a couple that never went out very often and we were going out for a special meal, I would be pretty upset, cause we could barely hear each other. We got there at like 5:30 and there were plenty of other seats in the place.....I would only use that table to seat people as a last resort. \n-Our waitress was kinda non-existent. Basically, she brought us a menu, initial drinks, food, and check. Which is kinda odd considering the serving station was a mere 5 feet from us! My water was empty for most of the meal and it never got refilled. Not a huge issue cause I did have my wine :)\n-Lastly, I don't know if I even have the right to mention this. I mean we did split a meal and that isn't how most couples do it. However, they brought out one salad and one meal. Like no extra dishes, no splitting anything, etc. I mean we are super laid back people so we never said anything and just dug in and ate. However, afterwards, both of us mentioned it to each other. The salad was so big. They could have easily split the amount of lettuce and dressing and just put it in two bowls so we werent reaching across the table. It would have just created one extra dish to clean...big deal.\n\nIt's little things like the above that can make or break an experience....especially when there are soooooooo many restuarants in the area. Unless someone happens to give us another gift card, we probably won't return.",,,,,,
-1,"Nancy... I concur! \n\nStatefarm Insurance recommended this shop and i took it there because they said the service was timely and professional. Well they have had my Porsche Cayene for a month and it always a reason why it isn't completed. In addition, they have it set up so you get updated online and can view the status of the vehicle. The key is they have to actually update it and only happens when you make a request because several weeks pass and you hear nothing. Now, most people know insurance only covers rentals for 30 days. Well my 30 days is up today. \nJeff, my rep was to call me back on Friday past for an update and now its Tuesday with no word. \n\nPOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ALL THE WAY AROUND!!!! I just pray the vehicle looks good!!!\n\nI will have to call Statefarm and let them know how much of a joke this company is!",,,,,,
-1,"I really don't understand how this place can be held in such high regard.  There isn't a particularly good drink selection, the food is terribly mediocre (the burgers are just terrible), and the bar itself has not a remarkable characteristic in sight.\n\nWhile all that is bad enough, I've always felt that the employees here are tremendously standoffish with anyone under 40, and this is the only place I've been to downtown where they'll chase your party down after you walk in the door.  \n\nWith so many fantastic places in downtown Champaign, the only reason this one hasn't gone out of business has to be the location.",,,,,,
1,"Excellent service, great food. Nachitos came out and made me laugh, as the name implies that they are small. They are not. Great fajitas too.",,,,,,
-1,"Over the years I have stayed here several times on family trips, or for business, or conferences.  There was a time that this place was showcase, remember back when the big competition was the Ramada on the north side of the street?\n\nWhile the conference center is just fine, I would suggest moving along on the hotel.  There has been a boom the last few years in mid-range hotels in town, and this facility is now completely dated.  The pros are a better than average location, a better than average free breakfast, and an indoor pool if you have kids along.\n\nThe rooms are dated, and the layout pushes the definition of suite.  The bathroom was tiny and the dressing/grooming mirror was out in the main room.  Climate control was all through a window unit that does both heating and a/c -- no instructions and nothing but a cryptic touchpad to use, plus in-room noise from the unit.  There seemed to be a lot of exterior noise as well.\n\nThis is not a *terrible* option, but with so many newer 2.5 star options that are price competitive in town, it is worth taking a look at other locations that will give you more comfort.",,,,,,
1,"Great value for the money!... great staff, free wifi, and very close to the airport. When i booked the room i was a little worried because it was so close to the airport but you cant hear anything. The only reason why i do not rate it a 5 is because there is no pool or fitness area. But for the price you really cant beat it! Plus a really friendly front desk girl understood our concern for not wanting to pay for a full night since we were coming in at 4 AM and she allowed us to stay that half night for free (even when we were willing to pay something for the night she said dont worry about it get here safely) and then we stayed Friday and Saturday. The room could use a little bit of an update, but once again what do you expect when your paying only $50 a night!.... OVERALL GREAT STAY! :D",,,,,,

I felt a proposal from my long term boyfriend was eminent (I was right) and wanted to get my nails done since I (finally!) stopped biting mine. I was fairly pleased with the look of my French tip manicure for the first two days. However, my tech (can't remember her name) was really aggressive with cutting my cuticles even though I jerked my hands back, \""Oww!\"". Now, not even a week later my polish is hideously chipping and I have little skin tags above my cuticles due to her roughness. In spite of this fabulous ring on my finger I shun at showing it to people because of my gross nails. And I was charged $17 for a natural nail French tip?! Locating my polish remover now and will NEVER return!",,,,,,
1,Nice little cozy neighborhood market.  I was in the area and decided to drop by to check out what was fresh and get a drink.  From reading the other reviews I would've love to try their pizza.

-1,"Laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages, but the adults that play at this establishment, honestly kind of creep me out.  The best time to bring your children here is during the middle of the week, because there is always an abundance of birthday parties on the weekend, and it can take hours before you are able to participate.  Each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large, with many areas to run around and attack friends.  Bring your childhood self here for a good clean time!",,,,,,

1,"For reasons unknown, I have a bias against English food. So when the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen were a bit unappealing, I knew this place was authentic. \n\nThis place looks a bit old, but not trashy. When I ordered my Jameson and ginger ale, being asked if I'd like it in a pint glass made my day. This bar is awesome. There's a nice selection of beers for a reasonable $5 a pint. I had some Ace Pear, but there were tons of ales I'd never heard of to choose from. I'll be back for those.\n\nThere are plenty of activities to keep busy while getting trashed here. I've never seen so much room in a bar devoted to dartboards. It was right in the corner with ample throwing room, and I loved it! There are also a couple billiards tables, some light gun arcade game (Try it after a few--don't shoot the cows!) and even some patrons sitting at poker tables. \n\nI'm definitely coming back here to play darts and watch rugby. Maybe I'll even try their fish and chips. I wonder though...do Brits really hang out here?",,,,,,
-1,"People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).\n\nCame here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's, but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace. I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in, but my dad insisted that it was probably \""not that bad\"".\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n- Cheese wontons (Um... they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons. Who does that?! It's supposed to be CREAM CHEESE!! And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in.)\n- Chicken Lo Mein\n- Beef Lo Mein\n- Shrimp and Broccoli w/ Sweet and Sour Soup (The soup was the most disgusting texture of I-don't-know-what. Needless to say, that was left untouched.)\n\nLet's just say, not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout), the food itself was just utterly disappointing... A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland, yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves \""authentic\"" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker? It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of. We literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!!! ... unless you're a snake that is.",,,,,,
-1,"This place SUCKS.  The pharmacist and his assistants are EXTREMELY condescending and prejudiced about older people.  My sister's friend was treated extremely horribly by these people and they never apologized, they just said \""we get a lot of elderly people in here so we often lose our patience.\""  They still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card.

-1,"As for a place to spend money uptown I'd skip it.  The bar is ok, the food is ok, it's nothing special. It's a convenience sort of thing, I'd imagine if I was in from out of town and looking for something quick to eat, a place to shoot the bull, and I was staying upstairs in the Marriott I would be ok with it.  The only reason I give it a measly 2 stars is because there are better options all around, this sort of competition should have been motivation to update the menu and decor. \n\nMy best experience here:  We used it for a Sunday brunch my family put on during our wedding weekend.  For that experience the food was great, the service was excellent, but that is not their \""normal\"" operation.  \n\nI guess if it's raining out and you are stuck and have no place to go I'd check it out. But under any other circumstances you'd probably get a better meal by walking a half block in any direction.",,,,,,

We told him we were just browsing for now. He backed off and let us browse, but kept a watchful eye on us and knew exactly when we had narrowed down our choices. He approached a 2nd time, at the perfect moment.

I had to rush to get there after work and still didn't get there until 5:45.\n\nIt is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude.\n\nI'd rather spend my money at Goodwill!,,,,,,
1,"I love me my Juan's!  \n\nI debated between 4 and 5 stars.  I decided on 5, and I will tell you why!\n\nFOOD gets the 5 stars- a rating for \""Old School Mexican Food\""; not for Elements or Kai.  In the genre of budget-priced Mexican food, it's a 5 star.\n\nThe food is SOOOO good!  It is that old school Sonoran style type of Mexican I remember from when I was a kid in Phoenix (60's-70's).  It is simple, generous servings but not monstrously so.  \n\nThe staff are long-term, get to know you types.  They work hard, and are very easy going when it comes to just about anything; even when you pay, they'll take your group's bill and allow you to pay one at a time, so no dealing with a split check a the table.  This is good for groups going out for lunch from work.\n\nIn the early 90's there original location was on 16th St- TINY... and they were renown for their burros.  They are still a mainstay today and if you aren't certain of what to order, get a burrito.  Their tortas are also exceptional.  I am partial to the basic combo plates.\n\nThe drawbacks:  and yes, there are some-  \n\nTIME.  I would go more often, but the amount of time you will wait can be very inconsistent.  Even when we arrive early (for lunch), there can be delays.  I shouldn't be gone for more than an hour for lunch, and have been 90 minutes twice when out at Juan's.  For me, this is a problem.  And even though i really like the wait-staff, i think that there are some organizational issues that cause the hold-ups.  Maybe understaffed?  I don't know for sure, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nCHIPS.  I like the chips and hot sauce, but don't LOVE them.  They are the old school variety, which are OK but I do like me some really hot out of the fryer chips served with cold chunky salsa, and that's not what you'll get here.  You will get the smooth red hot sauce and usually tepid thicker chips. \n\nIf you  haven't tried Juan's, and you don't have an inflexible schedule, DEFINITELY give them a try.  Order an old favorite, and see if you like how they prepare it.",,,,,,
-1,"\""Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?\""\n\n\""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile.\""\n\n'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.\n\nI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \""saved\"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \""Why don't you like caraway?\"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \""I really don't like the taste.\"" When she asked me \""Why?\"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \""sauce\"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \""real\"" texture. Foul, foul, foul. \n\nHence, the grilled cheese.",,,,,,
1,"I love this place! It's where I first discovered my love of sushi, I had eaten sushi before, but nothing quite as amazing as the Vegas roll I had here, and I am OBSESSED with it, it is the best I have ever had. also the ramen here is delicious. I recommend getting a big bowl of the Hakata.",,,,,,
-1,"Fresh Donuts always says good morning would you like to be my friend. I work close to the shop and I love to surprise my co-workers and customers with a warm donut.  The couple that took ownership are very nice and seem to be producing a small following.  The owners are puting in the hard work to build a business and seem to be on the right track.  As the business grows I look forward to giving Rainbow Donuts more stars.  \nLook for a bright purple building, its kind of hard to see if your driving East on McDowell.",,,,,,
1,"We love this place and always order the same thing.  House salad with ranch, wings (dry with honey hot sauce and ranch on the side) and a deluxe pan pizza.  By the time we get to the pan pizza, we are only able to manage 1 slice each and take the rest home.  The food is consistently good and the service is great.  Some nights they have karaoke night so it can get a bit loud.  But if it's bothersome, then take your food to-go.  Thankfully this place is just around the corner from our house.  We are definitely repeat customers.",,,,,,
1,"Seriously!!!!!!!!!!!!! What I have witnessed tonight, I have never been more embarrassed for a customer(s)!!!! The service, atmosphere, prices, and most importantly cuisine are nothing but top notch at this establishment!!!!!!!  My server, whom by the way, has been in the hospitality industry for over 23 years, that I have had the pleasure to be served by for over 10 of those years, and is a well known and appreciated all around great and hardworking individual in the community got rather the short end of the stick tonight.  The table of four came in during,(as always Arrivederci had a rush during dinner in the restaurant side) as well in the lounge, would make any kitchen busy. Of course the kitchen is busy, but always highly productive in preparing food.  The table griped all night, rolled their eyes their server, complained about their entrees, and to my horror even after the \""happy hour in the bar only\"" got explained to them, actually got up from their seats and walked to the bar, ordered drinks and so non- chalantly came back to their table!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who does this????? P.S.  THEN. . . . . . as the server cleared the table, he opened the bill folder and saw the \""YOU'VE BEEN YELPED\"" card!!!!! What I don't understand is why \""shoppers\"" feel the need to come in and make the exprience the worst it could possibly be and treat the servers like that!!!! Why can't they just come in and have the real restaurant experiece the way we all expect and do when we walk into any other establishment or Arrivederci's?????   I have been coming here consistantly year after year and speak from experience first hand!!!!  I feel for the poor server who had to deal with this kind of behavior.",,,,,,
-1,"Went with a group of 9 (one of them our 2 yr old) here and it was a Friday night so we understood a wait was going to happen so we gave our name and went to wait, they told us a 40 min. wait time, well 30 min. in we heard them call my friends name, went inside and they said no sorry they didn't have enough seats for 9 only 6 so never mind, went outside to wait again and after another 15 minutes my friend went in to ask if our table was ready yet, they said it would have to be another 40 minutes because when they had called our name the first time they crossed our group off!!! Needless to say we told them they were the dumbest lousy people in the world and left to eat at Zipp's on Bethany Home near 15th street, we had a great time and great food there instead!",,,,,,

1,"LOVE this place. Traditional Mexican food, family owned.  Food is awesome, Phoenix Metro Area has lost many of it's family owned Traditional Mexican Restaurants and we were so happy to find Los Taquitos.  Frequent here often.  The pazole soup is one of my favorite dishes, homemade, chunky, just enough spice.  The menu has plenty to choose from & the prices are reasonable.  \nWe ordered at the counter & it wasn't long before they served us a delicious, hot meal.  Atmosphere is very Sonoran Mexico as well.  If you want good Mexican food, Mexico style, go here.  We give this place & frequent it often ...  a double thumbs up.",,,,,,
1,I don't even know where to begin. Ive never had a bad sandwich. Tried many different ones. My favorite one is the kgb. It's amazing. Try the purple haze beer. The home made rice crispy treats. Oh my God and the drink selection.. they have TANG ON TAP!  LOVE THIS PLACE!,,,,,,
-1,I only go here if I have no other choice. This place is filthy and outdated. The bathrooms are yuck and this whole place should be redone! Nasty!,,,,,,

-1,"I was waiting for my laundry on Ellsworth last week, when I decided to kill some time and find nearby food.  A bagel sounded good and the Bagel Factory felt like an appropriate transition from the Laundry Factory.  I'd never been to the Bagel Factory before, but figured they'd have decent bagels and their coffee had to be better than Crazy Mocha. \n\nThe place was kind of a mess.  When I entered, I saw stacked boxes topped off with cartons of bottled water and individually packaged goodies stacked in front of the bagel case, which seemed sloppy and strange. It felt like a regular storage place for new merchandise, not a new shipment in active transit.  I wondered how an establishment like this could afford to exist on Ellsworth Ave, a neighborhood that is trying to exude upper-class image. Once I looked up from the hoarded pile of shit blocking the counter, my eyes skimmed over the mass of individually wrapped frosted cookies covering the other counter. My mind was taken to the memory of an off-roading experience a few years back; those times when you're driving down the highway in say western Illinois, and you end up at some shabby mom-and-pop bakery, like this one, and you think to yourself \""I'm having a unique experience...\""\n\nGiven that I was coming from the cleanest laundry facility I've seen in my life, these first five seconds at the Bagel Factory were perhaps moderately surprising.  The woman behind the counter had several projects going on and I waited for about two minutes until she asked me what I'd like.  These two minutes were a fascinating two minutes, as the man behind the register was chatting up some eight to ten year old girls.  They might have been neighborhood kids, or not.  There was a familiarity to their conversation, which was only subtly uncomfortable as his tone was sordid at worst, belittling at best.  When they got around to paying for their bagels he asked, \""are they naked or do they have cream cheese?\""  My head turned as the elder of the two said, \""cream cheese.\""  \n\nBy now I'd ordered my bagel and approach the register to pay for it and he says to me, \""got a lotta earrings there, bet you set off all sorts of metal detectors.\""  I responded with \""not really,\"" as I handed him my credit card and he handed me a coffee cup.  He printed my receipt, tore it from the spool and said in a sleazy tone, \""paper trail...\""  I typically would have reacted to that, but lacked the energy after my first round of finals week.  \""Be safe out there,\"" he said as I turned to walk away, which triggered a spine-tingling sensation up my back.  Had i just been sexually assaulted or blatantly judged for wearing a few hooped earrings on each ear?  I was wearing Abercrombie and Fitch, skinny jeans and sperries.  Seriously? \n\nIn the end, it makes no difference.  This guy is a creep, and my feeling is that he holds some sort of managerial role at the Bagel Factory, which leads me to conclude this place belongs out of town ten-twenty miles where this man can find animals to harass rather than little girls and college students.  I generally go out of my way to support small business and family owned operations, but this place is the exception.  I will never step foot in this establishment again.  \n\nThe bagel with cream cheese was alright and the coffee was okay but not worth $5.19.",,,,,,
1,"I know it gets a lot of bad reviews, but since I've been going to this place since I was a kid, and sweet and sour pork is my favorite \""Chinese\"" dish, I'm giving it 5 stars. I remember as a kid, all of the Chinese food buffets had a thin sweet and sour sauce on crispy bits of breaded fried pork, but every other buffet I go to now has a very thick, overly sweet sauce. It's not a desert, it shouldn't be so sweet, and Golden Coin has been making this dish the same for so long, it's an absolutely perfect blend of sweet and sour. No they don't have a big selection, but it's better to make a few great items than to make 1000 mediocre items.",,,,,,

1,"I have been to Cheuvront a couple of times, but this time was my first actual meal here. I had just finished a big exam and really needed a glass of wine.\nMel had the open faced Tuna Steak sandwich, wich was beautiful but a little difficult to eat. Thick slices of avocado and thin slices of sear ahi tuna on a ciabatta roll. She said it was delicious.\nI ordered the Grilled Cheddar Cheese. It was exactly what I wanted- melty, cheesy, and sublime. I paired it with a glass of Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, which I reccomend. It's a fruity but crisp white and it really hit the spot.\nThis is a great date spot. This is the place to go for a new wine suggestion. I'll be back soon.",,,,,,
1,"My husband and I went to Fudd's after a long hiatus and I have to tell you, we're going back again within the week!  I am trying to eat healthy but he was craving a burger, so we went anyway.  They have a turkey burger that is to DIE for!  I am craving it as we speak, and just announced that we should be going there tomorrow night for dinner.  I got the burger plain for the most part; added shredded lettuce, tomatoes, jalapenos, a small amount of mayo and some ketchup.  Voila!  That was one of the greatest burgers (beef included) I have ever had in my life.\n\nHad both the steak fries and some of the sweet potato fries.  Each excellent.  Love this place!!",,,,,,
1,"Love it! No one, not one person in town beats their green chile. The beans are delicious.  Must try!",,,,,,
-1,"I came here and ordered the baja burger. It was DISGUSTING. Greasy, with wilted vegetables and absolutely dripping with excess juice. I could barely eat it, but I was so hungry that I just held my nose and forced down a few bites. The sweet potato chips weren't much better; too greasy and stale. My friend had a strawberry daiquiri, which I also tried. It was acceptable, but the taste was off. \n\nThe service wasn't good either. Our waiter neglected us, and we did not feel at all taken care of. I will not be back.",,,,,,
-1,"I wouldnt call this a salsa club. Id call it just plainly a club with some latin flavor?  it looked ok, i liked the outside patio?  it was crowded. but i left outta there wanting to go to a real latin club.  the bartender was the best though, she knew exactly what we wanted and the drinks were mixed well and after we came back she still remembered what we had.  I give her an A plus.\nI more than likely will not go back.",,,,,,
1,"Whenever I step inside LGO, I feel like I've been transported to a small village in the South of France. I forget there's a cactus population down the road and a desert mountain out the window. All I can think of is how treatfully delicious their larger-than-life muffins are, how scrumptious their cookies are and how wonderfully filling their selections like the tuna melt and wood fire pizza are. Whether I'm in the mood for a cup of coffee, a full breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, a sweet tooth craving, a delicious pizza or a bottle of wine; LGO is my go-to spot. \n\nSo my suggestion is to visit LGO if you\n\n...Like good food \n...Like a good atmosphere\n...Are looking for a place to relax and read the newspaper or magazine \n...Are looking for a place to do some off-site work during the day\n...Are looking for a family-friendly and reasonably priced spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner. \n...Want a cup of coffee\n...Want an afternoon snack \n... Are hungry \n\nAnd when you do find an excuse to make your way to LGO, here are some of my top suggestions:\n\n- Commuter Sandwich \n- Crepes \n- Tuna Melt \n- Tuna Sandwich \n- Turkey Sandwich \n- Pizza \n- Chelsea Kitchen Burger \n- Homemade English muffins\n- Any cookie (my favorite is the apple one...I believe it's seasonal)\n\nNote: If you go during lunchtime, or on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, be prepared to go on the hunt for parking and a seat once you get inside. But don't let it dissuade you from your visit. It's worth it, I promise!",,,,,,
-1,"Ok, don't get me wrong I have found some unique stuff here, but that was years ago. Now I feel like I'm shopping at a target outlet with awful customer service. Half of the clothes there were shirts from target, and they were maybe 2 dollars cheaper than they were new, which is a bummer when you go in looking for something fun and creative and unique for a good price. \n\nOn another note, the customer service just plain sucked. I don't go in expecting much, but for them to be rude is just such a turn off from the store. I want to love this store, but lately it just seems like a joke. I won't be giving them my business anymore.",,,,,,
1,"Great little feel-good joint. Lots of locals who appeared to know each other well, but not to the point of being exclusionary to strangers. Good prices and good selection. Even had a food special (looked good) but didn't try as we had eaten elsewhere prior-to. If I lived in Mesa, I'd probably be here at least once a week.",,,,,,
-1,"Overall experience was disappointing. For all of the awards that they've received that they display in the entrance, this experience was not good. Food was okay, probably one of the most bland general tsao's chicken I have ever had. And last but not least, the service was terrible. I had to wait 20 minutes for my second glass of water. If you are looking for a good Chinese restaurant, your best bet is to save a few dollars and get a better meal at Panda Express at the east town mall across the street.",,,,,,
-1,"Seated in the bar after having made reservations a week in advance. That, paired with a mediocre menu and overall experience, gives this two stars. Save your money and stay in town. I would probably send you to the (gasp) Olive Garden before I referred you here.",,,,,,
-1,"I'm not much of a fan for this place. I like the idea of eating at buffets and not getting up to get your food, but the food here is just not up to par with me. I didn't even get another plate after my first; however, I found myself just eating all the sweet stuff. =T Sugar makes things better, right? LoL!\nI do like one thing from this place (but it's not enough to make me want to come back here again) and that's their sopaipillas; however, I feel like it used to be better before because they actually put stuff on it, but when I came here, they served it plain. I had to drench it with chocolate syrup. \nI was really surprised that it cost about $20 for two people with drinks included...I know I can spend my $20 else where and be satisfied completely. Sorry...",,,,,,
-1,"We have gone to this Pizza Hut in the past and were not satisfied with the service. When we first moved to our house, this location and the one at Lawyers & Margaret Wallace both argued as to which location was supposed to deliver to us! We didn't feel like leaving the house last night and decided to give them another chance. They were 20 minutes late, the pizza and wings were cold, and the customer service was terrible! I will not be ordering from this place again. I am really surprised this location has been in business as long as it has.",,,,,,
1,"Well, Squid, I gotta tell yuh... this CVS must have really changed a lot after you were there!\n\nI too got upset with Walgreen's.  That's why I came here.  I'd prefer to do business with a local pharmacy, but I want a Pharmacist available 24/7 (it's just a Psycho-Ceramic thing (for the uninitiated Psycho-Ceramic means I'm a Crack Pot)).\n\nThis store isn't as nice as doing business with a local, but the people are friendly, and there's merchandise on the shelves, and the folks here know where it is every time I ask.\n\nSo, all-in-all, for a national chain, it's quite good.",,,,,,
-1,"In town on business and I always try to find places like this.  Wow, a martini bar not named the Blue Martini?  OK, I'm in!\n\nSo I strolled over and walked in.  First impression was it was a cool, cozy, and trendy joint.  Liked the exposed brick walls, lighting, etc.  Only problem is, I don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!\n\nSo I grab a table in the bar.  It was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  Two bartenders made eye contact with me so I figured they would be waiting on me.  I figured wrong.  I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a \""deer in the headlights look\"", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying \""here's your sign\""!\n\nSo OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.\n\nA few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say \""some\"" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  \n\nIt seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.  I will return to try a martini, but I will pass on the food.",,,,,,
-1,"I've been to Tram's Kitchen a few times with friends and I hear good things from people about this place.  Personally, I don't see what is so special about it.  It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.  \n\nThat said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).  I prefer dining at Pho Minh to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings.",,,,,,
-1,"This place is failing in every way: their service is dismal, their food is greasy/tasteless/disgusting, and the kitchen/dining room are absolutely filthy. I have no idea how or why they continue to remain in business, but I would suggest that if you ever must make the mistake of consuming this disgusting excuse for food, then for goodness sake dine in.",,,,,,
1,I love my pets doctors and staff this animal care hospital is wonderful caring employees kind loving with my pets . I told some of the best girls ever at the Starbucks next door they mentioned my name and the hospital gave them their exam for free with my referral I was shocked when I heard that pleasantly surprised and with that news I will be giving more referrals .  I use this hospital for all my pets and my sons dog too they really are caring when my cat Roenick got hurt and attacked by a dog they were great and very kind and loving with me too as a pet owner . So yes I will say that my pets vet/doctors/ staff are amazing and affordable \nThank you all at animal care hospital you are wonderful,,,,,,

-1,"I am giving this business one star due to the poor customer service. The shop is fine appearance wise, but the lack of compassion and service from the person helping me was just unacceptable.  There was no compassion and advise from the sales clerk.  I felt I was just an annoyance.

Still I could have gotten over it but the straw that broke the camel's back was when I got into the car, went to close the OBD port and the knee pad was covered in grease.  YUCK!  \n\nThey couldn't be nicer people but not for me.  Sorry.",,,,,,
1,"Back when I was an undergrad at Arizona State, I took some classes at MCC as to avoid further blemishing my school record at ASU. I had this perception as many others have had that taking certain courses at a junior college level would be somewhat easier than that of a university, namely math and science type courses. I was clearly mistaken and earned a new respect for math courses taught at MCC. \n\nOne fall semester apart from my 15 credits at ASU, I also took two additional courses at MCC, a Calculus I class and a technical writing course. I was blessed to be in a Calc. I course taught by a Prof. Santini who began the class with... \""are you guys ready to get on the Santini roller coaster of fun?!?\"" upon hearing that I knew it would be an interesting semester. To say the least, it was more than interesting, although I barely passed, this guy knew his calculus, he had the passion and he instilled his teaching in that he wanted his students to understand the foundation of calculus, so, for him the basic formulas were meant to be second nature to us. His class wasn't easy, it was one of the most difficult undergrad courses I've taken but at the same time it was the most rewarding. The same went for my technical writing course in which my professor graded our papers to the nth degree. I have to admit that MCC has instructors that are great in what they teach and prepare their students to be competitive at the university level, well, that was my experience.\n\nI do admit that this is one of the more crowded and busy junior colleges since it serves as a feeder school to Arizona State plus many of its students, like myself were concurrently enrolled at ASU and MCC. Another lesson learned from MCC was my parking skills. I learned how to be hawkish looking for parking. Since my classes were mainly on the side of campus facing dobson rd, my parking options were limited especially since from mcc i only had 45 mins to drive to ASU, look for parking there and get to class. Even now when I have to go to MCC for something, I still get frustrated looking for parking. \n\nOverall, MCC offers quality courses taught by pretty good instructors, and I recommend supplementing your schedule by taking courses at MCC if you're already at ASU because whatever your final grade is at MCC you can transfer the grade for credit towards your degree without hurting your cumalitive gpa at ASU.",,,,,,
1,"I have been going to the Paisley Violin for years, since it was on Roosevelt. It has always been a neighborhood favorite.\nEverything is fresh, homemade and delicious.

1,"We are visiting from Texas and I have to say I'm very impressed with the food here! We came on a Sunday morning and upon arrival the parking lot was packed, and so was the inside, but we were seated right away. (Only a party of 2). The atmosphere was warm and homey, we sat in a corner booth. Our waiter was very nice and gave us plenty of time to order. We ordered the Denver omelet that comes with hash browns and subbed pancakes for the toast. It was wonderful! All the food was hot when we got it, the hash browns were REAL potatoes, sliced very thin. The omelet was huge, definitely big enough to split, and the pancakes were fluffy and delicious; even the syrup was warm! If I lived in Phoenix I would definitely come back here!",,,,,,
-1,"Completely INCOMPETENT staff.  After switching insurance plans and needing my 12 month prescription re-issued to my new provider, PP was horrible at processing this request.  After promising they would fax it over the next day, and having the pharmacy assure me they never received it for a week, it turns out that PP never faxed it over.  After having to constantly talk to the insurance company, the pharmacy and PP over the course of A MONTH (which I had to pay out-of-pocket for my prescription) I finally got a letter in the mail from my insurance company saying \""Cannot renew prescription.

-1,"I have mixed feelings about this store.  I am a Northside resident and want to support local business but the customer service here is very poor.  I usually buy 2-40# bags of dog food at a time and am offered help to my car about 50% of the time.  The store is very dirty and the staff do not seem friendly or healthy--maybe the cat dander is activating their allergies?!?  I understand others appreciate the kittens and cats roaming free, but I have gotten home to realize the dog food bags have teeth marks and puncture holes in them.  I give them 2 stars for the buying program another customer mentioned, buy 12 bags get the 13th free.  Overall, this store is disappointing.",,,,,,
-1,WAIST OF TIME!!! My husband and I were in town for our 3 year anniversary and came to Merts after a great recommendation. We went to yelp and read the over all great reviews and were excited about trying this place. We waited about 20 min which was a good sign. The hostess wasn't too friendly but she was super busy so I could understand. Our waitress was an older lady who took our drink orders almost right away. Here is where it went down hill....she took her sweet time coming back to take our order( I know she saw me looking at her like WTH?) once our order was taken those were the very last words she spoke to us. We waited an HOUR with not so much as an I'm sorry this is taking too long or can I get you anything else? Finally my husband overheard a cook in the back yell that our order had not even been processed yet and was 4th in line!!! We threw a 5 on the table for that nasty too sweet diabetes lemonade they gave me and left! WILL NOT RETURN. OH....I'm not sure what corn bread everybody else on this reviews was eating but ours was WACK! Barley warm and not sweet at all. This place has EXTREMELY POOR customer service. We left and went to Emeralds restaurant where the service was SECOND TO NONE!,,,,,,
-1,"I have to say I agree with a couple of the other reviews.  I SO want to like this place - the atmosphere is amazing, but the food and service will keep me away.\n\nWent there once again the other day and sat at the bar as it was still early enough to get a seat.  Waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order - not a huge deal as we were there to relax and in no hurry - but at Hillstone someone would have taken our drink order in 1 minute. \n\nCould just be me, the music was too loud and too catering to a 20 something crowd.  Doesn't fit the cool vibe of the space and sounds like the bartender or dishwasher selected the music.\n\nOrdered 3 small plates.  Calamari was cold.  Shrimp dish with toast was best and toast with mushrooms could be SO much better.  Overall, below average.  Ordered desert - chocolate torte - which was impossible to eat as it felt like it just came out of the freezer.  It needed one hour of defrost time.  To his credit, our server took that off our bill (without our asking, so good job there).\n\nOverall, atmosphere is great.  But, that's it.",,,,,,
-1,"I have tried this Olive Garden over the several years that it has been in Champaign and not once have I liked ANYTHING.  I don't get why it is so crowded all the time and people are willing to wait a long time just for a table.  The house salad is awful and so are all the soups.  I have tried several items on the menu over the years and I have always felt ripped off because it's so expensive as well as awful.  I try really, really hard not to go here but sometimes there are \""those\"" people who choose this place to have their birthday dinner or graduation lunch and I am forced to go.",,,,,,
-1,"If you are Coming here because the sushi, go somewhere else.\nNot much options on the menu and sloppy sushi.\nWhat they call specials, it's is a regular option anywhere else.",,,,,,
1,"One word... CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA!\n\nOk...it's one word if you say it like I do. I like to say it fast so I can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating part.\n\nThis place is awesome. I ordered samosas, garlic naan, mixed grill (tandoori oven cooked variety of meats) and chickentikkamasala *giggle*. The mixed grill was good, but the naan and the masala was the highlight. I had to slap the hubby's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing...ok...by 'slap' I mean I may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork, pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance...we're so playful. \n\nDISCLAIMER: *No hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before, during, or after the consumption of the delicious items procured from I.D.P. The improvised narrative describing the dinner-eating portion is fictional...the tastiness of the items we ordered is factual.",,,,,,
-1,I am not sure how someone thinks this food is great.  It is subpar and out of the freezer.  There is no way that this is Southern fare that is good or even tasteful.  Nothing is homemade and food is dry.  Service is nice and the lobby is good.  But please close and stop serving food that comes out of the freezer.  Grocery stores are always open.,,,,,,

1,Get my hair done every other week and never once have I had a poor cut. I stopped telling Tina how to cut my hair and just let her choose because every time it is exactly what I wanted without even knowing it. Rochelle cut and styled my hair for my wedding and it was amazing. The talent in Rochelle's is unmatched anywhere in the state/country. I highly recommend RSS. They are located next to www.Claritychiro.com  and phoenix fishing supply.,,,,,,
-1,Took my daughter and 4 1/2 year old Grandson to Red Robin last night. Arrived around 4:45 and were seated. Not many customers at the time. Sat waiting 15 minutes for a server to bring us menus. There were 5 or 6 servers standing around chatting with each other.  Finally got up and left.  Always wondered what it would be like to be invisible.  Guess I know now.  Won't be back!,,,,,,

-1,"ALERT TO PARENTS AND SHOPPERS OF CAROLINA PLACE MALL:  One of the employees of the massage parlor (Oasis) next to the kid's play area was caught inconspicuously taking pictures of my 4 yr. old daughter while she was playing there.  Even though it is private property, the General Manager of the Carolina Place will not ban him from working at the mall because it is not against the law to take pictures of little girls.  The police report number is 121005-2147.",,,,,,
-1,"We have tried this place two times. Food was decent at best the first time for dinner. The second time we walked out before our meal even started due to the dry burnt food on the buffet and rude service. It's now an ongoing joke in our household of \""are you hungry enough to even eat at China Town?\""\nWe're shocked it's survived this long with so little customers.",,,,,,
-1,"I found my uncle's Fossil watch in a box of old pictures on Christmas Eve. He died 9 years ago so it was a very sentimental find.  I wanted to get it resized, shined, and it needed a new battery as well.  I called ahead and asked if they did watched repair which they said they did. While they did replace the battery they maladjusted the watchband and as a result the watch would not latch.  This was very disappointing since it now fit worse than before. The young man who had been helping me admitted to not knowing what he was doing and that they did not have a watchmaker on staff and was kind enough not to charge me for the battery.  He meant well so the experience wasn't a total bust. However, better to say you don't know how to fix something than try and fail at the expense of the customer's time.",,,,,,
-1,"This place was great for atmosphere and large groups but the food actually sucked.  We ordered from the happy hour appetizer menu and our server was pretty slow and forgetful. She brought one of us crab dip that was cold (supposed to be served hot), then took forever to bring the drinks back. I asked if the southwest egg rolls were very spicy before I ordered, she said no and low and behold I get them and they are spicy.  The drink (margarita) was very strong and not sweet enough. Overall they get a D for food and an A for ambience and location.",,,,,,
-1,"Food: There are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  We've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  The general Tso's tofu and the Moo Shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  The eggplant was soggy and not great.  The portions are large.  Nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\n\nPrice: Tasty is cheap.  \n\nDrinks: N/A\n\nAtmosphere: Typical Chinese takeout place.  A photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  Located in the plaza next to Pizza Parma.  Decent location for that end of Shadyside.\n\nService: The employees speak poor English but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  The food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\n\n(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\n\n(-): food is nothing to write home about\n\nWould I go back again? If I'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else.",,,,,,
1,"I've been to Taylor's Cafe on several occasions... both for breakfast and for lunch.  Breakfast is served all day, and there is plenty to choose from.  As Shannon wrote, there is a variety of healthy options including several veggie omelettes and design-your-own as well.  \nServers are consistently friendly and even when the restaurant is crowded, I've never had to wait too long on my food... \nTaylor's is good for groups but it works for solo diners as well... guys may think it is a little bit 'fru-fru' but they will not complain when their food arrives - indoor and outdoor seating available.  My next visit will be one night for dinner - i think they have live music from time-to-time.",,,,,,
-1,"One of the most disgusting restaurants I've ever eaten at. I was on a business trip in Phoenix on decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The place was bad news from the very beginning.\n\nThe hostess was super unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell onto the table from the lamp shade overhead-- I should have gotten up then.\n\nThe chips were greasy, margaritas straight sugar w/ very little liquor and the enchiladas bland as can be. In addition to this, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom.\n\nYou couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant. It should be closed down immediately for its lack of cleanliness and poorly prepared food.",,,,,,
-1,"Hotel rooms were very outdated and the shower was awful (temp went from warm to scalding randomly), very cramped, and the shower head was not high enough to wash my hair without squatting (I'm 5'9\""). The walls of the rooms were so thin that you can hear people talking in the halls and flushing toilets in neighboring rooms. That, combined with random knocks in my rooms and the knowledge after checking in that this was one of the top ten haunted hotels in the US, made for a fitful night of restless sleep. \n\nGiving it a 2 star bc while it was one of the worse places I've stayed room quality wise, I'm highly entertained in hindsight at how scared I was in the \""haunted\"" hotel and have some good memories to show from it. Also, historic hotel that had housed stars like Marilyn Monroe so it was cool to see (although thankfully for only a night, I don't think my nerves could have handled a second)!",,,,,,
-1,"**WARNING: REVIEW PARTIALLY BASED ON BITTER GIRL SYNDROME**\n(you've been warned)\n\nSee, I don't really like this place.\n\nOk, maybe it's because the meal was planned around a gruesome and undue breakup, during which I cried into my soup and everything became tasteless, but THAT IS NOT MY FAULT. It's not my fault I can be simply too awesome for some to comprehend.\n\nMoving on.\n\nI tried it again sans ridiculous relationship errors (that's you, Isaac*!) and I, quite frankly, remain unimpressed. The pad thai is eh, and the soup I revisited was simply as bland as I remember, but without the enduring emotional frustration this time.\n\n*names have been changed to protect your stupid identity. Maybe not. Haha.",,,,,,

-1,"I unfortunately had the same experience as the other reviewer, I bought flowers for my wife and they died within a day or two.  Scary how similar my experience with the staff was.  They were rather rude regarding their poor flower selection and life of their flowers.  I definitely will not do business with them again.  Thomas H and Aurora E posted on the same day right after the \""owners\"" response using very similar language and typing skills; i.e. using caps for a number of words and the poor grammar is the same.  That is a little suspect but I know it happens on yelp.  It's rather sad this company has to stoop to such low levels.  You would think they would just apologize and want to offer good customer service instead of quoting policy over and over.  In the \""owners\"" 357 word response, not a single \""sorry\"" or \""we will do better\"" or \""we will make it right\"" comment.  Nothing but a long winded explanation about what their policy is and why they are like Macy's (ironic that Macy's actually has amazing customer service and would probably be upset knowing this flower shop is comparing their lack of customer service to Macy's).  I think that is very telling about the owner's and staff at this shop.\n\nI love supporting local business, but not ones that act like you should be thankful for doing business with them, it should be the other way around.",,,,,,

It's good stuff and the lasagna is delish, but do you want to venture to central PHOENIX across from Bourbon Street strip club, for over priced lasagna?  \n\nIt's good and if you are in the area, stop by but don't make a special trip.  It's just not worth it.  Bring a gun too. You're in the hood.",,,,,,
-1,"I went here the other night for an ice cream sundae with hot fudge and caramel sauce on it. I was disappointed that the hot fudge was overly sweet and gritty, like it was made from a powder mix that wasn't mixed enough. \n\nThe service was good, as was the remainder of my sundae.",,,,,,
1,"A trendy spot to hit up. I am not a big fan of wine, but gave in to coming here with my friend that loves wine. I hear there is a $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine on Mondays and Tuesday. Well last night (Monday) we got the $13 bruschetta (with 4 pieces you choose) and a $30 bottle of Grayson, a cab, all for $20. I mean what a deal.\n\nDark atmosphere, good food, good variety of wine. Definitely a great local business to support. Parking is probably the biggest problem you'll encounter.\n\nOh and they have a \""People Love Us On Yelp Sticker\""!",,,,,,
-1,"Hmmm...interesting.  My first nightclub experience in Phoenix.  We were originally supposed to go to Oaxaca for Caribbean Night, but when we got there it was dead *crickets*.  Lots and lots of people here!  Being from NY, I'm used to a very diverse crowd in lounges/clubs so it was weird partying in a place with only one demographic... I love dance music so I dragged my friend over into that room, but we actually spent more time in the salsa/bachata room because it had great ambiance and was filled with so much energy.",,,,,,
-1,"Recently, I decided to make a roadtrip mini-adventure to Phoenix.  Wow, what a city.  It's beautiful and in the middle of HELL.  Paradise lost, one might say.\n\nI made my reservations to the Rodeway Inn Airport after consulting the internet for a place to stay.  I made a few considerations, such as brand name.  I've been a big fan of Clarion Brand hotels, since I've stayed at Comfort Inn and Suites in a variety of cities over the years.  I concluded my internet reservation the day before and decided this was in a great spot due to airport proximity and brand name.\n\nWhat...a...mistake...\n\nApparently, Phoenix is abnormal compared to many cities I've stayed in.  The airport is beautiful but the surrounding area is not.  The hotel chain has a great reputation, but this place was not beautiful. \n\nHere, let me explain!\n\nI arrived at 0500 (5am for y'all) in Phoenix.  My reservation was made, but apparently the Clarion website differs from their policy.  My room was given away since I hadn't checked in by 6am, even though the Clarion website has a Room Guarantee that says they'll hold the room until 7am the next day.  I had a bit of kick back from the onside employee that night.\n\nHotel is rather nasty. It's old.  It's dilapidated.  It was all locked up (more to follow on that).  It was grungy.  Not pleasant, nor reminiscent of the Clarion brand.\n\nRoom was freezing, and appeared sloppily put together.  Curtains were ill fitting, going over the window A/C Heater system and blowing.  Also, the heat didn't work too well, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nBelow the heater though, that's where the magic was found.  A used Trojan Magnum condom and wrapper.  Now THAT'S good times.\n\nApparently, this hotel, this area, this side of the airport is known to locals for the strip clubs, prostitution and drug dealers.  Yup.  It's all that.  \n\nNot gonna be staying here again.  Sorry Clarion.  You've lost me on this one.",,,,,,
1,"This is a good place to bring the little ones to see if they're interested. The instructors are gentle and helpful with all of the kids. They have an introductory special that gives the student a chance to try it out before committing. Apparently you can work all the way up to a black belt, as there are several older students who are doing just that. The classes are organized by age, so the students aren't paired up with someone much larger or smaller. When they're starting they mostly practice evasion techniques and some judo grappling, and only practice sparring with other students as they get older. When my daughter first started she was really hesitant, but an instructor took her by the hand and helped her feel comfortable. Now she always has a smile when she's in class.",,,,,,
-1,"I've been going to this bar randomly over the last 5 years. It's definitely gone downhill.\nMy last experience here was when I was trying to plan a birthday party during happy hour on a Friday during the summer. When I called to reserve some space, they told me they only reserve seating areas for people who pre-purchase food. Which, the pre-purchase options were about $10-12/person. I wasn't about to pre-order food for a casual birthday get together. So, figuring they'd probly be very busy on a Friday night, we got there around 4:30. There were MAYBE 6 people around the bar. No one in the lounge seating area. I sort of felt undervalued as a customer for not being able to reserve space when no one was there. 5:30 came around, the bar got a little busier, but no where near the packed house crowd they painted as a picture for me when I tried making reservations.\nOur waiter was sub par. People sat without drinks for 20+ minutes, and some people just didn't get to order, because one person would order a drink and the waiter dashed off, leaving others to call out after him (to no avail.) He would basicalyl take 1-2 orders, and run off, not to return for 10 minutes. \n\nThis place is average in food price and quality. But the attitude of this place could be better. Go to Six Penn instead. They have outstanding service without the pompous attitude, and in the summer they have a roof top patio with a bar and lots of seating. Best in town!",,,,,,
1,"I went here for the first time on Sunday. I got the gluten free pizza and it was absolutely the best GF crust I've tasted. They get it from the Gluten Free Creations Bakery which is local. It is seasoned with rosemary and so delicious! Prices were reasonable, staff was very friendly and I would certainly recommend it and will definitely become a regular customer.",,,,,,
1,"Pane Bianco has changed in recent years - and they have only made the place more wonderful. I appreciate the expansion, as it makes the place a wonderful spot to meet friends for lunch without feeling cramped or overheated (by sitting outside). The french press coffee is to die for, and I can't wait to come back and try dinner! I had the soppressata which was just as delicious as I remembered from 8 years ago. And yes, I am a vegetarian!\n\nI also purchased some Hayden Flour Mill pizza flour that I cannot wait to try! It's incredible to me that they mill all that flour out back! Talk about eating local - it's locally grown wheat, milled right there in the back, packaged under their roof and sold to you. It's like a dream. So go - grab some to-go, meet friends, take your kids, and eat. good. food.",,,,,,
1,"Who writes a review for a chain? A person who's gone to the same store for four years, that's who! Take a hip coffee place, throw a bunch of Starbucks logos everywhere, and you have this amazingly friendly coffee house. I was anti-Starbucks but now I won't go anywhere else. The staff is friendly, fast, smart, and they don't change every month. \n\nThe outside sitting area is really nice and cozy. They have tons of seating and misters/shade for the hot summers.",,,,,,

-1,"The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4, & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. Ordered an app & left 25 minutes later, the lobster nachos never came, which sucked because I was quote excited about those. The place is gross! There was food & trash all over the floor & I watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. This was confirmed by my wife. Skip this place & go anywhere else in the Strip District",,,,,,
1,"Used to special order birthday cakes from Karsh's, but service and execution is consistently better at Barb's. Prices recently went up - my last custom quarter sheet ran about $70 -  but they'll make you a delicious cake that's a work of art or a fun conversation piece. \n\nNot Charm Cty/Ace of Cakes \""wow\"" factor, where money is no object, but these are experienced bakers who care about your satisfaction and who seem to enjoy a good challenge. They'll consult with you, discuss options, take the necessary time to get it right. I've always been pleased with their final interpretations.",,,,,,
1,I've probably eaten here 20 times.  10 times w/ my wife too.  Always good food and eaten a bunch of different things.  Good deal and good service too.  Food will surprise you,,,,,,
1,"My go to place when I want something delicious and quick. I always get the pho which is just so damn good! Noodles are soft and the broth is da bomb. Perfect remedy for a cold, sore throat, or an empty stomach. The other reason why I love this soup is that it has no stinky pho smell that most pho soups have. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?!\nComes in a big bowl that can be shared or have it all to yourself! A little pricey but nothing to cry about. Mmmm...craving one now...I should go before they close in 30 minutes...",,,,,,
1,"Came for breakfast,  but when I saw the roast beef sandwich with green chillies and cheddar cheese, I opted for that, and boy, was I happy!!! I find it surprising this sandwich is difficult to find in Phoenix,  so when I do find it,  it is a must try. Probably the best I have tasted -- lots of lean beef, thick full strips of green chilli, medium cheddar, nicely done grilled bread not dripping of butter (hate when grilled sandwiches are greasy with butter/oil). Every bite was hot and delicious.\n\nHubby ordered the chicken fried steak, eggs and hash browns.  I am not a fan of white gravy,  but this one I liked -- it had flavor,  imagine that!!! The breading on the chicken fried steak,  was very light, crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The steak was not chewy, either. .. good point here as a chewy steak just turns me off!!! Hubby loved every bite, especially the gravy,  he is a fan of country gravy,  and said it was the best he had had. \n\nIt was a great experience,  and we are eager to return -- hubby wants that meatloaf!!!",,,,,,
-1,"Unbelievable experience! Literally unbelievable. I waited 50 minutes and finally walked out. Receptionists were beyond awful. I booked 3 style appointments in advance for a wedding. One person was taken right away, 20 minutes later the second person was taken.  I WAITED 50 MINUTES while being ignored by the receptionists.  I can celled because the others were almost done and we would be running late. My stylist finally came out and said he'd quickly do my hair. What !! I'm not paying $100 to get rushed service. We were looking forward to a relaxing, fun experience. More unbelievable, I waited 20 minutes to pay for the two services. One receptionist couldn't take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party.  I was so close to walking out and not paying. Unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own. I can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as I am still furious in the way I was treated.  I would expect some ambiance at $100 for shampoo & style. I could never recommend Izzazu. Denham & Company is on Market Square, their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the Fairmont. I am calling the concierge tomorrow informing her of my experience.",,,,,,
-1,"My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place for a long time. The food was great and the service was great! Everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position. The food quantity and quality started to go down hill. There was hair in my food not once but TWICE every time I order a rice dish. The new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended I even brought it up. The sushi is very plain and not high quality either. As a college student, they forget to discount our meal from time to time but its the food that matters right? Their prices are constantly changing and for the amount of the food it is not reasonable. We will not be coming back at all. There are other places to go that actually care about their customers satisfaction.",,,,,,
-1,"Reman was ok, but the sashimi I ordered was terrible... It doesn't look fresh, the cut is not clear,  and it even has some chewy stuff in my tuna and another kind of fish. Never know sashimi can be this bad. Worst sashimi experience ever.",,,,,,
-1,"Seems to me that Champaign-Urbana would be a great market for an outstanding breakfast restaurant, with all the visiting parents wanting to take their kids out for breakfast.    Le Peep isn't that place.  It fits well in the category of mediocre breakfast restaurants in Champaign.  The wait times are very long (and not accurately assessed by the staff) in a very small waiting area.  Add slow service, noisy atmosphere, and uninspired yet pricey food, and that all adds up to mediocre at best.  I'm still searching for an exceptional breakfast expericence.",,,,,,
1,Great waiter. Was nervous when we came and there was nobody else in the restaurant. Food was outstanding and timely. The Chicken Saltimbuco (sp?) was outstanding. Fried Calimari was outstanding-- and cooked perfectly. Light and crisp. A small but good wine list (chianti reserve was good) and the liquor pours (scotch-Macallan 12) were generous. Others at the table had the Chicken Parm and the Stuffed Bell Peppers-- the bell peppers received rave reviews -- it was a special of the night. Chick Parm was pretty standard with a very good marinara sauce. \nOnly complaint was that it was quite warm in the restaurant.,,,,,,
-1,"Ok, this place has decent food.  Well, depending on the day.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.\n\nHowever, for a small mom and pop place, they don't seem to do much to make people feel welcome.  \n\nThe last time I ate there was the last time.  I had breakfast with a friend of mine, and all was going well, weak coffee aside.  We ordered some breakfast, and the waitress (who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors) asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes.\n\nMy friend said \""I'd love it on the side, please\"" only to be told \""No.\""  When he said \""no?\"" she replied \""Gravy is complimentary, and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy.\""\n\nI made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash, then I would save them the time and effort by not going back.  Problem solved, all dishes are clean!\n\nSkip it and go to Sam's cafe.",,,,,,

All the bottles of alcohol are still covered with paper cups, the beer taps are still wrapped and plugged, and the 10 staff are all hovered in the corner. No reason the place is empty!!!!!!! Got our nachos wrong but surprisingly the burger was amazing.\n\nOnly reason this gets 2 stars is it's connected to the baseball stadium.\n\nP.s: prepare to pay for parking too! We risked the ticket and got lucky on the meters after it expired",,,,,,
